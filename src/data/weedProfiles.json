However, when mature flowering plants and rhizomes are removed seedling may germinate from the soil seed bank and follow-up treatment is critical. Integrated control methods combining techniques, with long term follow-up is advised for success. Preventing spread to new areas by animals is difficult, so preventing seed set is important and the best form of control. When controlling Asparagus aethiopicus, the underground rhizome need to be removed or comprehensively killed as re-growth can occur. Large plants with extensive root systems and underground rhizomes (underground growing points), can sometimes survive herbicide application as some rhizomes are not  killed and follow-up may be required.\n\nChemical control: In large infestations spot spraying or brushing with herbicide is more practicable than manual removal as soil disturbance can de-stabilise fragile coastal soils and leave sites open to re-infestation by Asparagus aethiopicus and other weeds. Timing of application is important with some herbicides and follow up spraying will be needed to control newly emergent seedlings (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Breadon et al. 2006; Le Cussan 2006). Herbicides can be applied directly to leaves and stem when actively growing at the correct time of year. Many rhizomes may survive and re-sprout.\n\nThe cut-stump treatment (cut and swab; cut and paint or cut stump methods), where the plant is cut off just above ground level and herbicide is applied to freshly cut stem. However, if the plant has large energy reserves some underground rhizomes parts can survive and regrow so follow-up is advised when using this method. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Small infestations can be controlled by hand pulling and crowning, and should be used where practical. Hand pulling can only be used for small plants, and the rhizomes (main growing points at the top of the soil where the stem emerge) should be removed when hand pulling. If the plant breaks leaving any or all the rhizome, plants will immediately regrow.\n\nCrowing: Other smaller infestation with large plants should aim to remove fertile above ground parts, and the below ground rhizomes (underground growing points that stems emerge from). Crowning is a useful method for removing Asparagus aethiopicus and other crown-forming Asparagus species (with all underground points concentrated close to the soil surface where the stem emerge). This method of control involves removing the rhizomes (the growing points) and prevents the plant from regrowing. Other roots and swollen tubers can be left in the soil as these are not growing points and will not regrow. However, as some rhizomes may be missed, (left in the soil), continued monitoring should be carried out not only for re-growth but for seedling germination (Office for Environment and Heritage, 2013).

As well as being naturalised in Australia it is also naturalised in southern Europe, New Zealand, western United States and the islands of the north Atlantic ocean collectively known as Macaronesia (USDA 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Control of Bridal Creeper (Asparagus asparagoides) is possible by chemical, mechanical means and biological control. However, when mature flowering plants and rhizomes (underground growing points) are removed seedling may germinate from the soil seed bank and follow-up is critical. Integrated control methods combining techniques, with long term follow-up is advised for success. Preventing spread to new areas by animals is difficult, so preventing seed set is important and the best form of control. When controlling Bridal Creeper (Asparagus asparagoides) the underground rhizome, need to be removed or comprehensively killed as re-growth can occur. Large plants with extensive root systems and underground rhizomes can and will survive herbicide application as some rhizomes are not  killed and follow-up may be required.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides have been the most effective method of control. However, because Bridal Creeper often grows in areas of native vegetation, it is particularly important to avoid contact with desirable plants or soil near tree root zones. Isolated plants can be treated with a recommended herbicide applied by spot spraying. As infestations become larger, a strategically staged approach for removal is advisable to ensure that treated areas are not re-infested (CRC 2003). In citrus and avocado orchards it is difficult to spray Bridal Creeper entwined in the leaves of trees. Pruning lower limbs to provide access underneath trees, a practice known as ‘skirting’, enables spot spraying with a recommended herbicide. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical removal is not effective unless all the rhizomes are dug up and destroyed. This may be possible for new, small infestations or as a follow-up after several years of herbicide control of a larger infestation. Slashing the stems and leaves may prevent fruit production and slowly deplete root reserves but it will not eradicate an infestation (CRC 2003). Small infestations can be controlled by hand pulling where practical.\n\nHand pulling can only be used for small plants and infestation. The rhizomes (main growing points at the top of the soil where the stem emerge) should be removed when hand pulling.  If the plant breaks leaving any or all the rhizome, plants will immediately regrow if conditions allow.\n\nMechanical control: However, for large dense infestations where little to no native plants remain, mechanical removal of above ground parts parts may help.\n\nCompetition and management: Grazing can provide some control of Bridal Creeper. Tamar Wallabies on Garden Island in Western Australia have successfully kept it at low levels there, and sheep grazing may be an option to control it under trees in remnant vegetation, woodlots and shelterbelts (CRC 2003).\n\nDisposal: When removing material off-site, rhizomes can regrow and re-shoot if not killed. Any rhizomes that come in to contact with the ground, on or off site, will re-shoot. Material can be composted or solarised and the same methods should be used for the fruits containing seeds, as these can germinate and grow in to new plants. If the plant is being removed from gardens, dispose of it through local government kerbside collection or tip facilities. Fruiting shoot material should be bagged immediately to avoid it being dropped or dispersed by birds. Root material (which can survive being dried for long periods) and seeds should not be composted or mulched (CRC 2003).\n\nFire: Fire can also be useful in reducing above ground biomass of larger infestations. In winter-rainfall areas, Bridal Creeper often emerges before the first autumn rains so herbicides may be applied before post-fire regeneration of native vegetation. As well as improving the effectiveness of herbicide application, fire may help to destroy Bridal Creeper seed and the dense tuber mat. However, use of fire requires permission from government authorities and its frequent use may endanger the survival of many native plant populations (CRC 2003).\n\nFires in late summer and early autumn can remove all under-storey vegetation and improve access for later spraying. If fire is used, regrowth should be treated carefully with herbicide to limit above-ground growth and further reduce the stored root reserves. Infestations should be monitored regularly and over several years because of the probability of regrowth from remnants of the root system. Regularly check for new incursions, carefully removing them or treating them with herbicide, as necessary. For new or small infestations hand digging of roots may be an appropriate follow-up technique (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Effective treatment of Bridal Creeper with herbicides or manual removal is expensive and labour intensive. These control methods are not feasible in many areas because of the size and inaccessibility of infestations. Biological control is viewed as a preferred management option for Bridal Creeper infestations of this type (Wills 1999). There are three biological control agents that have been released in Australia. However, it will take many years for the biological control agents to reduce the density of Bridal Creeper due to the huge reserves stored underground in tubers (CRC 2003). An effective biological control agent on Bridal Creeper is the rust (Puccinia myrsiphyllii), that attacks leaves and stems that can have a major impact on the levels of reserves in the tubers, but the rust is not effective on the Wester Cape Form. There is also a leafhopper, a sap sucking insect that feeds on the photosynthetic cells causing them to turn white, and a leaf beetle that feeds exclusivly on the young expanding new tissues of leaves and shoot tips therefore reducing biomass and fruit production.\n\nFor further information see the Asparagus Weeds Best Practice Management Manual (available at https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/-/media/OEH/Corporate-Site/Documents/Animals-and-plants/Pests-and-weeds/asparagus-weeds-management-manual-130486.pdf ).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Seeds germinate in autumn and winter in leaf litter and at soil depths of up to 100 mm. Buried seed that does not germinate rots within two years, while seeds on the soil surface may be viable for at least three years. Compared to many other weeds, Bridal Creeper has a short-lived seedbank (CRC 2003). Bridal Creeper plants take at least three years to reach flowering size, the flowers appearing along the length of the shoots in August and September (CRC 2003). Shoots of established Bridal Creeper typically emerge from the soil in autumn but earlier emergence can occur in years of high summer rainfall.\n\nThe green berries turn red in late spring to early summer (CRC 2003). There can be large differences in fruit production between years and sites. Early autumn rains allow a longer growing season, which favours high fruit production. The amount of fruit set is significantly greater where shoots are able to grow vertically by climbing up shrubs and trees, and less where the plants are heavily shaded, suffer water stress or where there is a high level of competition between shoots (i.e. older, dense infestations) (CRC 2003).\n\nShoots (above ground stems and leaves) may be present year round in warmer areas which normally have summer rains or are under irrigation. In cooler areas above ground growth dies back in late spring – early summer as temperatures rise and soils become dry, leaves turn yellow and fall and stems die back in (CRC 2003)."

    "controlMethods": "Athel Pine (Tamarix aphylla) can be controlled by chemical and physical methods. However, follow-up is always required to control re-growth from root-stocks. Germination by seeds may also occur. Preventing spread is the most cost effective form of weed control. Cleaning down machinery is useful as soil on machines  may contain seeds or root fragments that can re-sprout and grow in new areas.\n\nChemical control: Various herbicide are effective and available for uses Herbicide application methods are via\n\nStem injection (drill-and-fill): Herbicide can be injected into the bark of larger stems (Australian Weeds Committee 2011). Stem injection delivers herbicide directly to the sapwood. Stem injection should be no more than 100 mm apart as Athel Pine does not translocate herbicide laterally.\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface killing the plant to prevent regeneration from the rootstock. Cut stump application is suitable for large trees, but care must be taken to ensure that wounds are treated immediately and fallen trees are not left in moist soil where they may again take root.\n\nBasal barking: Herbicide can be applied to the bark of smaller stems. This method involves applying herbicide mixed with an adjuant to the lower trunk or stem of woody plants up to around 50 mm in diameter to a height of 30–40 cm above ground level. Juvenile trees can be controlled by basal bark application, but full coverage is essential for this method and difficult if surface sand is present. Seedlings and juvenile trees are effectively controlled by foliar application (ARMCANZ 2001) making sure that the plant gets a complete coverage of herbicide.\n\nFoliar spraying: Foliar herbicide spraying is the application of herbicide solution to weed foliage in the form of a spray, and normally is used for extensive seedling growth and limited regrowth from cleared trees and shrubs.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Non chemical control methods are usually followed up with chemical (herbicide) applications.\n\nPhysical control: Hand pulling can be useful for small infestations of seedling under 60 cm or where weed control requires sensitive avoiding native vegetation.\n\nMechanical control:  Machine control can be by bulldozing to remove individual trees or large populations. Care should be taken to remove all the root system and ensure that sand is not covering uprooted and felled stems as they may re-shoot. Chainsaws can be used to remove individual trees but herbicide must be applied at the same time (ARMCANZ 2001) with care being taken due to brittle branches.\n\nCultivation: or blade ploughing or the use of a cutter-bar is suited to large infestation of seedlings in wide, open, sandy creeks and rivers.\n\nFlooding: Can be used in areas regulated by waterways to kill plants by submerging and drowning, but thus method is slow acting and non-selective.\n\nBiological control: Although biological control is being investigated by the United States of America Department of Agriculture for other Tamarix species (ARMCANZ 2001) biological control is currently not available in Australia. The athel pine has not been endorsed as a candidate species for biocontrol research by the Environment and Invasives Committee (Hervey et al 2023).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Seeds of Athel Pine (Tamarix aphylla) germinate for most of the year provided moisture is available but main germination period is autumn.

    "controlMethods": "When controlling Opuntia Prickly Pear species, an integrated weed management approach is usually desirable especially for larger infestations.\n\nChemical control: While several herbicides are recommended for managing Prickly Pears, chemical control is not always effective, as many species occur on rocky slopes, and infested areas must be checked and resprayed over several years if necessary (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Methods used are:\n\nFoliar spray covering all pads\nStem injection (includes drill and fill method on every 2-3 pads)\nBasal bark and cut stump (not normally used or considered best practice).\n\nHowever, plants are extremely hardy and follow up and monitoring may be required for 1-2 years to ensure plant do not re-sprout. Registered herbicides,  techniques and on-label instruction should always be followed in your state or territory. A variety of herbicides (chemicals) are know to be effective. Please see Sheehan & Potter (2017) for an overview. Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au. Permits from state or territory Environment Protection Authorities may be required if herbicides are to be sprayed on riverbanks.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical control either by manual (hand) or mechanical (machine) removal can be feasible and cost-effective for all species of Opuntia (Prickly Pears).\n\nManual (hand) removal appears to be one of the most effective control methods for for scattered and small infestations (Sheehan & Potter 2017). However, the spines make manual removal of these species difficult (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Using tools and avoiding spines and glochids is a top health and safety concern when working with Prickly Pears. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) must (should) be worn, and tools used that eliminate or significantly reducing handling of plants with spines and glochids used.\n\nMechanical (machine removal) is useful for large dense impenetrable stands (Sheehan & Potter 2017). This method is useful for removing bio-mass and increases accessibility for other follow-up control methods. Machine removal with front end loaders causes high levels of disturbance and will require planning and long term follow-up using an integrated weed management techniques for cacti and other weeds that could colonise the area. Normally mechanical control should be carried out when conditions are dry to avoid damaging soil reducing soil disturbance, reducing likely spread of plants. However caution should be employed as some species have glochids that are airborne and are more likely to dislodges and injure workers with PPE like masks or respirators worn with eye protection\n\nDisposal: Care must also be taken to remove and properly dispose of plants parts. Pads, flowers, fruits and even small sections of stems if left on the soil surface can produce roots and grow into a new plant. If one larges plant is uprooted, broken up, and left on the soil surface, each pad will take root and form a new plant. Where one plant was present there would now be many plants. The root system must also be dug out to prevent regrowth (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Plant can be buried at a depth of 1 metre on or off site. Burning plants (all vegetative, flowering and fruiting parts) with other dry materials for plants thahave dried out over summer can also be used to kill plants. However, you should consult you local fire service for advice and permissions.\n\nFire: The effect of fire on Prickly Pears are not well understood. For some species it has been shown that fire is not effective in killing all plants and they can recover with great vigour. In addition, fire and strong winds are thought to spread the stem segments of some species aiding spread (Sheehan & Potter 2017).\n\nBiological control: Biological control using Cactoblastis moths or Cochineal insects can be effective on dense populations, and outlying plants can be infected by transferring infected pads to them (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). However, there are a number of species of Cochineal insects that are host specific, and may destroy one species of Opuntia but not others (R. Chinnock, pers. comm.). The effect of these agents appears to be limited in colder climates (Muyt 2001).  Correct identification of Opuntia species is required so the host specific biological control can be used. Further information can be found in Sheehan & Potter (2017).",
    "bestControlSeason": "All Prickly Pears reproduce from broken-off stem segments which develop roots from lower areoles (spots on the stem segments) that are in contact with the soil surface. Detached plant parts from some species have been known to last up to 3 years indoors.\n\nMost Prickly Pears that occur in Australia can also reproduce by seed. Seeds germinate any time of year and plants generally flower at three years old. All Prickly Pears are long lived (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001)."

Best results are obtained by working from areas of light infestation towards heavier infestation, and long-term follow-up control is required after initial attempts. Minimise both disturbance to land and excessive use of fire to retain vigorous native vegetation and reduce the opportunity for Lantana to become established (CRC 2003). The combination of methods used will depend on the extent of the infestation, the land-form on which it is found, and the time of year during which control is to be undertaken. Re-vegetation of treated sites is also important. For more information on Lantana control see CRC 2003.\n\nChemical control: A variety of chemical controls are used to control Lantana and are described in detail in Stock (2009). The addition of penetrants and surfactants (adjuvants) to some herbicides may increase the herbicide absorption into the Lantana’s sap system.\n\nFoliar sprays: can be applied when the plants that are actively growing application to thoroughly wet all foliage and stems to the point of run-off. Use a nozzle configuration and pressure that ensures canopy penetration. Consideration for application of chemicals (normally listed on label) are; plant condition and size; environmental condition; application timing. Selective and residual herbicide can be used\n\nRoot application: is when a residual herbicide can be applied to the soil between the base of the plant and the drip-line, usually when the soil is wet or rain is expected , and is normally used where there are no native plants to be affected.\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface. This method is used for Lantana provide reliable control and can be useful where options are limited by the risk of off-target damage or the poor condition of the Lantana plants.\n\nCut, scrape and paint method: The cut, scrape and paint method is a variant of the cut stump method that requires more effort but is often more effective.\n\nBasal bark application: This technique involves the application of herbicide mixed with diesel directly to the lower trunk and over branches of the Lantana plant—similar to a form of chemical ring-barking.\n\nStock et al. (2009) and and DPI NSW (2019) provide detailed information on the use of herbicides to control Lantana. See References, links and further resources. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au. NOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control,  or manual methods such as hand pulling and grubbing and hand cutting may be suitable where infestations are hard to access with machinery and equipment and for the protection of certain threatened species, or where there is a desire to avoid the use of chemicals. as a follow-up treatment. It is most effective after rain when the soil is moist. A mattock, chip hoe or lever can be used to remove larger plants, including their root system.\n\nHand cutting with a powered brush-cutter can create access into heavy infestations for carrying out other control. Hand-held brush hooks or machetes can also be used.\n\nWarning: Touching Lantana can irritate skin and eyes and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) must be worn, examples, protective glasses or goggles covering eyes, and long sleeve tops and full length pants and boots with gloves protecting skin.\n\nMechanical control: Mechanical methods are usually most suitable for the control of extensive Lantana infestations. Methods used include; slashing involving cutting plants at the soil surface with blades or chains that spin parallel to the ground. Stick raking/pushing involves using a tractor-mounted rake or blade to push Lantana out of the ground. A stick rake attached to\na dozer removes the majority of the stump and root system from the ground while minimising the loss of topsoil. Mechanical grubbing removes entire Lantana plants from the ground with an implement attached to a tractor, backhoe, excavator or even a bobcat. It is suitable for scattered to moderate infestations of mature Lantana (Stock 2009).\n\nCompetition and management:  Competition from existing/sown grasses and scrambling legumes with subsequent trampling and grazing by livestock can reduce the size, height and density of a Lantana infestation, allowing access for follow-up controls. In native ecosystems re-vegetation is useful.\n\nFire: Control of Lantana using fire is  practiced as a cost-effective means of removing biomass and Lantana suppression. After a burn follow-up methods are critical in an integrated control program to treat any regeneration and germination of Lantana. Can be used in agricultural and natural ecosystems, see Stock (2009) for information.\n\nBiological control: Lantana has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.\n\nIn 1902 the first attempt at biological control of a weed targeted Lantana in Hawaii. In Australia biological control agents were first introduced in 1914; so far 31 species have been introduced. Research into biological control is ongoing, and several agents are currently being examined for suitability of release (CRC 2003). Of the 16 species that have established, four insects have had a major impact on Lantana: a sap-sucking bug (Teleonemia scrupulosa); two leaf-mining beetles (Uroplata girardi and Octotoma scabripennis); and a seed-feeding fly (Ophiomyia lantanae). The biological control agents vary in their effectiveness against the many different types of Lantana. For example, Lantana can drop its leaves when stressed, depriving some agents of their food (CRC 2003). Also these agents are seasonal and do not generally result in the death of the plants but should be used as part of an integrated control program.",
    "bestControlSeason": "Germination most frequently occurs following the first summer storms, but may occur at any time of the year when sufficient moisture is present and as soil temperature increases. Initial seedling growth is slow until the roots become established, after which close stems intertwine and begin to form thickets. Flowering does not usually commence until early in the following summer and then continues until March or April (CRC 2003).\n\nHowever, Lantana flowers whenever the soil is moist and the air is warm and humid. For much of its range along the Queensland and New South Wales coasts, this results in almost continuous flowering and fruiting. Further inland, peak flowering occurs several weeks after soaking rain (25 mm or more) and is usually accompanied by good fruit set (CRC 2003).",

It was also accidentally introduced to North America in the late 1800s from Europe, probably as a contaminant of alfalfa or clover seed or in soil discarded after use as ships' ballast, and has since become a widespread weed occupying millions of hectares in the United States of America and Canada (Carpinelli 2005).",
    "controlMethods": "Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea stoebe subsp. australis) can be controlled and managed with herbicides with young plants being physical removed ensuring perennial root is removed to avoid regeneration.  Cultivation is generally not recommended as these spreads root fragments to form new plants. The seed of Spotted Knapweed are able to survive in the soil for well over five years (Davis et al. 1993), so populations must be revisited to remove new seedlings and resprouts (Bio-Integral Resources Center 2000). Given the persistent nature of the plant it is likely that a strategic integrated approach will be necessary to effectively prevent the spread of Spotted Knapweed (Brown et al. 1999).\n\nChemical control:  Herbicide is effective in controlling small populations if applied when plants are actively growing, particularly in the bolt and bud stages (Sheley et al. 2000), Please also check the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Single plants or small populations can be removed by hand before setting seed, as long as the entire tap root is pulled out.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation is not effective as it will not disturb the deep roots of the plants. In addition, it may spread fragments of root, spreading the infestation.\nCompetition and management: Once controlled Spotted Knapweed is likely to re-invade unless the areas are re-vegetated so that competition from other vegetation remains high and suppresses the weed (Kennett et al. 1992; Lindquist et al. 1996).\nFire: Targeted fires can have a significant effect on Spotted Knapweed populations, with annual summer burning the most effective regime to reduce reproduction (Emery & Gross 2005). However, as the plant can regenerate from top-burnt root-stocks and since the seeds are likely to survive all but severe fires (Abella & MacDonald 2000), using fire alone may simply open more space for seedlings to colonise and increase the sunlight available to them (Sheley et al. 1999).",

These collections were all made between January and March (summer to early autumn) when the plants were in bud or flowering (AVH 2021). In the North American populations, the plants generally germinate in autumn or early spring and then overwinter in rosette form. In the second or subsequent years the stems elongate, flower and produce seed over the summer months before dying back to the rosette in autumn (Watson & Renney 1974).",

Annual Ragweed survives mowing, trampling, grazing and cultivation due to the longevity and dormancy of its seed.\n\nChemical control: A number of herbicides are registered for control of Annual Ragweed. As it has developed resistance to at least one herbicide in Europe, care should be taken to rotate the herbicides used to avoid this problem (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nPhysical control:  Where feasible, plants can be pulled by hand. However, contact with flowering plants and pollen should be avoided by those prone to allergies. Annual Ragweed survives mowing, trampling, grazing and cultivation due to the longevity and dormancy of its seed. Plants may be slashed or mown prior to setting seed (i.e. at the early flowering stage or immediately prior to flowering). Checks should be carried out to ensure flowering is prevented in any re-growth that occurs. Regrowth may occur from soil seed banks and these plants must also be controlled.\n\nCultural: Infestations can be minimised by maintaining healthy, dense pastures (DPI, NSW 2019). Stock will only occasionally eat ragweed when it has set seed and will subsequently pass the seed. Most improved pasture grasses will suppress Annual Ragweed, provided a dense, healthy ground cover is maintained.\n\nFire: With heavy infestations, opportunistic burning can be a useful tool in controlling Annual Ragweed if paddocks have not been overgrazed. Burning needs to be done when adequate soil moisture will allow good grass cover to grow back.\n\nBiological control: Annual Ragweed has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Zygogramma bicolorata, a beetle, and Epiblema strenuana a stem gall moth, have both successfully established on Annual Ragweed, and are known to be widespread and exerting a degree of control in most effected areas from Brisbane in Queensland, to the north coast of New South Wales ( Palmer and McFadyen 2012).",

As with many weeds, controlling infestations early and preventing further spread will be the most effective form of management (Sainty & Jacobs 1981). Spiny Rush management programs using mechanical controls, chemicals, cultivation, altering salinity and drainage, and pasture management measures have been proposed (Anderson et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNon-chemical control: Even quite small plants can require a large amount of effort to remove (Sainty & Jacobs 2003); however, small stands of Spiny Rush may be dug out effectively, as the plant is shallow-rooted. The roots need to be severed and the top growth may also be burnt if seed is present.  Because the plant likes damp situations, improving drainage may help to reduce populations, but this would not be a suitable control measure where it is a weed in natural habitats such as wetlands (Ermert 2001). Machinery is used to cut spiny rush just below the ground surface. After physical removal,plants are heaped and burnt, and thenthe soil is cultivated to encourage the growth of seedlings. Follow-up cultivation over the following two summers are necessary to destroy seedlings, although some seed will remain to germinate in following years.Burning or slashing and then spraying or wiping new growth with herbicide can increase herbicide uptake, making the treatment more effective. (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nChemical control: Chemicals are not considered to be very successful in the reduction of Spiny Rush (Ermert 2001), but can be used to some effect in association with other control measures. Chemical control is often impractical because of the difficulty of application to dense patches; therefore, mechanical removal of the existing growth, although costly, is often the most practical starting point in a control program (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Mowing or slashing can help manage St Barnaby's Thistle, however, this should be done at the right time, too early and plants may regrow and set seed, and to late when in flower may allow seeds too mature on cut material.\nCompetition and management: Effective control can be maintained by encouraging legume-based pastures which, with adequate fertiliser, provide maximum competition to the weed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Experiments have shown that the common native ringed wallaby grass (Rytidosperma caespitosum) [as Austrodanthonia caespitosa] competes strongly with St Barnaby's Thistle and may be a factor in preventing invasion of South Australia's native grasslands (Hay et al. 2006).

    "controlMethods": "The control of Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis) in Australia should aim to contain and eradicate populations. Ideally, control or eradication should be aimed no later than the rosette stage, prior to the development of the creeping root system, to prevent spread by root fragmentation (Kravchenko 2006). As with Perennial Thistle (Cirsium arvense), another perennial herb in the same family, that also has rhizomes with similar life cycle and requirements as Perennial Sow-thistle, the same or similar control methods should apply.  The best means of control is to prevent initial establishment, or maintaining good quality pasture free from bare areas as germination is always more successful on open sites. If an infestation is established control is problematic because of the rhizomatous nature of the plant. An integrated approach using a combination of strategies is likely to be the most effective.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides probably provide the most effective means of controlling Perennial Sow-thistle, and various types are used in North America (Cowbrough 2005). The same methods and consideration could be employed for Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis) that are for used for Perennial Thistle (Cirsium arvense). Herbicide applications should be effective if the right herbicide is chosen and applied at the right time. As with other thistle species, seedlings are the most susceptible growth stage and provided the plants are growing vigorously, and treatment is applied as soon as germination is complete. Care should be taken to differentiate between seedlings and rosettes that have regrown from root stock as the response to control methods are different. Although the top growth may be susceptible to many herbicides, long term control is difficult to obtain, as it is with most deep rooted perennials.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Isolated plants and small infestations can be physically hand pulled, hoed or grubbed. It is important that all root fragments are collected to prevent any new plants re-establishing from root fragments left buried in soil. The site may require monitoring over several years to ensure that any re-sprouting plants are destroyed.\n\nCompetition and management: Tillage and cultivation of land has varying levels of effectiveness depending on the stage of the life cycle, the type of tillage, and the frequency. It is most effective in the early stages of growth, ideally at the rosette stage, prior to the formation of creeping roots. Fragmentation of the roots may, however, exacerbate the infestation, as root fragments left buried in the soil may develop into new plants. Cultivation of infested areas with mature plants is not advised because broken fragments the rhizome and can seriously spread the problem by moving roots with vegetative buds to new areas. The only exception to this is if the ground can be repeatedly cultivated every couple of weeks to totally prevent emergence of any shoots until the root system is exhausted. It is thought that over about a year the root system will die. However, it may be at least two to three years.

Tillage is inappropriate in areas of high quality vegetation (Kravchenko 2006; Bond et al. 2007).\n\nGrazing: In situations where Perennial Sow-thistle is found to be palatable to stock, grazing can be used to reduce flowering and seed set (Stajsic, 2008 pers.comm.).\n\nAlso see CABI (2020) for control methods used around the world.",

Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: can be effective in controlling Barleria. It is thought that mowing, followed by a spraying of any newly emergent plants with a broadleaf herbicide, is likely to be effective. Success was achieved with herbicide on the Kimberley and Katherine populations.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Pulling by hand is effective where the population is small but gloves are needed due to the spiny nature of the plant and correct disposal of the pulled plants is essential (CRC 2003).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",
    "bestControlSeason": "Barleria is considered to be a perennial species because it lives for more than one year. It is well adapted to the climate of northern Australia, which has distinct wet and dry seasons. During the dry season when virtually no rain falls (generally May- September), its stems, leaves and flowers die off although the roots remain alive. The vegetation then regrows after the first rains of the wet season, and it flourishes during the remainder of the wet season. Dieback of above-ground vegetation on Boigu Island in the Torres Strait generally occurs between September and November, a little later than on the mainland.\n\nSeeds germinate early in the wet season, following the first significant storms, and grow steadily during the remainder of the wet season. It is not definitively known how old seedlings are before they first flower. In Katherine plants do not flower until they are at least half a metre tall and their estimated age is one year. In northern Australia flowering occurs at the end of the wet and start of the dry season (typically April-May). Fruiting occurs several months after flowering, at the end of the dry season. Seeds germinate fairly soon after they are dropped, soil moisture permitting.\n\nOn Boigu Island Barleria is thought to flower and fruit over a more extended period. This is probably related to the climate, which has more regular rainfall and shorter dry seasons than on mainland northern Australia.\n\nBarleria plants can probably live for about ten years in good conditions (CRC 2003).",

    "origin": "Water Hyacinth is native to the Amazon Basin in South America, but is now introduced and widespread as an aquatic weed throughout warm freshwaters of the world. It was spread from the late 1800s as an attractive ornamental plant for water features. It mainly occurs in tropical to temperate climatic zones to latitudes around 40 degrees (Aston 1973; Sainty & Jacobs 1981; Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Weber 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Water Hyacinth is declared as a noxious plant in all states and territories. It has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.\n\nWater Hyacinth can be extremely costly to control once infestations are allowed to spread so preventing its spread into uninfested areas is vital. Reduce nutrient levels entering waterbodies to lower the risk of invasion and spread (Muyt 2001). It should not be cultivated or grown in garden ponds (Sainty & Jacobs 2003) and pond material must not be discarded into waterbodies\n\nNon-chemical control: Small infestations can be removed by hand. Harvester machines are required for clearing larger areas (Weber 2003). The weight of plant material can be enormous, making physical removal only appropriate where suitable equipment is available or infestations are easily accessible (Muyt 2001). Removed material must be disposed of properly, such as drying and burning (Land Protection 2007).\n\nChemical control: There are several herbicides effective on Water Hyacinth and these need to be approved for use in aquatic environments. Contact your local council or weed control authority for advice on weed control. Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nFollow-up programs and monitoring will be required after physical removal or chemical control due to the likelihood of regeneration from seed which can survive in mud and sediments for many years. Waterbodies such as farm dams can be drained to kill existing plants, but plants are likely to grow from the stored seed bank so ongoing monitoring and treatments will be required.\n\nBiological control:  It has been effective in some tropical regions (Sainty & Associates 2001), but with little or no impact in cooler climates (Muyt 2001). Information on biocontrol is provided by Forno & Wright (1981), Harley (1981), Waterhouse (1994), Wright & Purcell (1995), Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001), Center et al. (2002), Burton (2005), CSIRO Entomology (2005, no date), Kathiresan (2005) and Land Protection (2007).\n\nControl is best through a combination of habitat manipulation (denying the plant water may be possible in some situations), biological control agents and approved herbicides (Sainty & Jacobs 2003). Mechanical removal of dead plants will help avoid water quality degradation by masses of rotting plants (Plant Protection 2007). Integrated control programs, including continued monitoring, will control and prevent the further spread of Water Hyacinth (Wright & Purcell 1995; Muyt 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Burton 2005; Land Protection 2007).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Flowering of Water Hyacinth occurs in summer and sometimes into autumn (but can begin as early as October), with each flower opening for 1-2 days and then withering. After a spike has finished flowering, the stalk gradually bends down into the water to submerge the developing fruit, which contains numerous seeds. After 2-3 weeks the seeds are released, drop to the bottom and sink into the mud where some germinate the following spring, and the seedlings float to the water surface to develop into new plants. Much germination occurs on mud beside waterbodies or on bottom mud after water has been drained. Seeds can germinate in a few days or remain dormant for possibly up to 15 years. The top growth usually dies back in autumn, but the crowns of the plants overwinter and begin new growth the following spring (Aston 1973; Sainty & Jacobs 1981; Cunningham et al. 1992; Wright & Purcell 1995; Williamson & Faithfull 1998; Muyt 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "controlMethods": "Control of Asparagus Fern (Asparagus aethiopicus) is possible by chemical and mechanical means. However, when mature flowering plants and rhizomes are removed seedling may germinate from the soil seed bank and follow-up treatment is critical. Integrated control methods combining techniques, with long term follow-up is advised for success. Preventing spread to new areas by animals is difficult, so preventing seed set is important and the best form of control. When controlling Asparagus aethiopicus, the underground rhizome need to be removed or comprehensively killed as re-growth can occur. Large plants with extensive root systems and underground rhizomes (underground growing points), can sometimes survive herbicide application as some rhizomes are not  killed and follow-up may be required.\n\nChemical control: In large infestations spot spraying or brushing with herbicide is more practicable than manual removal as soil disturbance can de-stabilise fragile coastal soils and leave sites open to re-infestation by Asparagus aethiopicus and other weeds. Timing of application is important with some herbicides and follow up spraying will be needed to control newly emergent seedlings (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Breadon et al. 2006; Le Cussan 2006). Herbicides can be applied directly to leaves and stem when actively growing at the correct time of year. Many rhizomes may survive and re-sprout.\n\nThe cut-stump treatment (cut and swab; cut and paint or cut stump methods), where the plant is cut off just above ground level and herbicide is applied to freshly cut stem. However, if the plant has large energy reserves some underground rhizomes parts can survive and regrow so follow-up is advised when using this method. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Small infestations can be controlled by hand pulling and crowning, and should be used where practical. Hand pulling can only be used for small plants, and the rhizomes (main growing points at the top of the soil where the stem emerge) should be removed when hand pulling. If the plant breaks leaving any or all the rhizome, plants will immediately regrow.\n\nCrowing: Other smaller infestation with large plants should aim to remove fertile above ground parts, and the below ground rhizomes (underground growing points that stems emerge from). Crowning is a useful method for removing Asparagus aethiopicus and other crown-forming Asparagus species (with all underground points concentrated close to the soil surface where the stem emerge). This method of control involves removing the rhizomes (the growing points) and prevents the plant from regrowing. Other roots and swollen tubers can be left in the soil as these are not growing points and will not regrow. However, as some rhizomes may be missed, (left in the soil), continued monitoring should be carried out not only for re-growth but for seedling germination (Office for Environment and Heritage, 2013). Prevention of flowering is vital in existing stands as once fruits are set, control of their dispersal by birds is near impossible .\n\nMechanical control: However, for large dense infestations where little to no native plants remain mechanical removal of above ground parts may help. infestations the removal of above\n\nDisposal: When removing material off-site, rhizomes can regrow and re-shoot if not killed. Any rhizomes that come in to contact with the ground, on or off site, will re-shoot.

    "controlMethods": "General management of Bathurst burr (Xanthium spinosum) is primarily targeted to prevent seed generation. An integrated approach to managing Bathurst Burr should therefore be implemented which eliminates existing plants by spraying or grubbing then establishing competitive pasture to help prevent new plants from establishing (DPIW 2007). Eradication of Bathurst Burr requires the prevention of seeding for at least four to six years and the elimination of sources of reinfestation (Faithfull 1998). Some seeds may remain viable for up to eight years (Anon. 2007).\n\nChemical control:  Bathurst Burr is susceptible to some herbicides, particularly on young plants. Bathurst burr is highly visible when growing, and control in pasture is readily achieved by commonly used selective herbicides, or spot spraying small infestations with non-selective herbicides (Government of South Australia 2021). Spraying should be carried out before the burrs have formed. Pasture improvement combined with herbicide treatment is the favoured method of control in grazing lands (Land Protection 2006). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Removal by hand is not recommended due to the sharp spines. Small infestations are best dealt with by hoeing or grubbing / chipping and is only economical for small areas, individual plants or isolated populations. It is also an effective follow up control method for plants not controlled by other methods to prevent seed set. Plants carrying burrs should never be dumped, as the seed may be easily spread but should be gathered and burned.\n\nMechanical control: Repeated cultivation of seedlings after each germination event is effective on arable land. Mechanical slashing should be undertaken before the burrs have formed (Faithfull 1998). Successive flushes of seedlings during the summer may require follow up control. Inter-row cultivation is commonly used in row cropping such as sorghum, corn and cotton to control seedlings that have germinated after irrigation events (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nCompetition and management: Strong competition, particularly from a well managed pasture containing legumes, will greatly inhibit the successful establishment of Bathurst Burr.  Adult plants are not easily eaten by livestock, due to the roughness of the leaves and stems and care needs to be taken when grazing to ensure there are no seedling plants, which are toxic to animals and could result in death (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nBiological control: An indigenous Australian Blight Fungus (Colletotrichum orbiculare) occurs on some infestations and is being developed by New South Wales Agriculture as a mycoherbicide. The accidentally introduced rust fungus (Puccinia xanthii) affects both Noogoora Burr and Bathurst Burr. The Bathurst Burr seed fly (Eurraresta bullans) was introduced from South America in the 1920s and affects large areas of burr in New South Wales and Queensland but provides no long term control (Faithfull 1998).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Each burr contains two brown, flattened seed about 9 mm long, one of which is capable of immediate germination, but the second may stay dormant in the soil for several years. Dormancy depends on the permeability of the seed coat. This is broken down by high temperatures. Germination may also be controlled by day-length and daytime temperatures. The result is a staggered germination which makes Bathurst Burr seedlings difficult to control and allows the plant to exploit the variable environmental conditions under which it grows (Department of Agriculture and Food undated).\n\nOf the two seeds in each burr, one germinates the first spring or summer and the other does not germinate until the second or third year. Some seeds may remain viable for up to eight years (Anon. 2007).",

It is not as important a problem in native vegetation as it is in agricultural areas. Only seedlings and young plants are susceptible to herbicides.\n\nPrevention: Prevention of introduction and spread is a vital part of control and management of the plant. Once plants are established an effective control program should prevent seed production, kill roots and root buds, and prevent infestation by seedlings from the persistent soil seed bank. The area also must be managed in such a way that prevents the further spread of seed or plant parts to unaffected areas.\n\nChemical control: Seedlings and young plants are fairly susceptible to herbicides, however well established plants are able to regenerate from the extensive root system. Herbicide control of Field Bindweed generally requires multiple chemicals and repeated applications (Holm et al. 1977; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Zollinger & Lym 2000). In the United States of America, some strains of Field Bindweed have become resistant to some herbicides (Pheloung et al. 1999).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nIt is suggested that the best control of Field Bindweed is an integrated approach including a combination of tillage, herbicides treatments and competitive crops (Holm et al. 1977; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Zollinger & Lym 2000). Other management tools include flooding and biological control agents. Field Bindweed is killed when covered to a depth of 15 to 25 cm with water for 60 to 90 days (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nBiological control: There are a number of biological agents in use or being evaluated in North America (California Department of Food and Agriculture (2008).

Biological control research has been carried out but has proved ineffective  but whichever program is adopted it will need to be planned and sustained over a number of years to control infestations and prevent re-invasion.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides are the most reliable blackberry control method and should be used with other control methods. However, while several herbicides are recommended for managing Rubus species, different blackberry species react differently to herbicides. There are many herbicides registered for use on blackberry. A mixture of triclopyr + picloram used with or without aminopyralid gives the best long-term control. (DPI NSW 2019). Spray healthy, actively growing plants with new leaves on the cane tips and apply to both the outer and inner leaves with the first year plants are easier to kill. (DPI NSW 2019). Well-established thickets may need more treatments like slashing or burning to access and promote fresh new growth that affectively adsorbs herbicide. The regrowth of plants that have attained up to 1 m can then be sprayed with herbicide (DPI NSW 2019). See the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical control either by manual (hand) or mechanical (machine) means removes biomass, but alone is rarely successful because it’s hard to remove all the roots and is normally used with a follow-up herbicide.\n\nGrazing: Goats can make a start on controlling heavy infestations and prefer blackberry over improved pasture species. Sheep and cattle may graze blackberry seedlings if there is no other palatable feed around also stopping young daughter plants from establishing. Again flow-up with herbicide will kill plants.\n\nFire: Fire will not kill blackberry infestations but is  used to reduce biomass allowing access areas and subsequent to new growth for follow-up herbicide treatment.\n\nBiological control: Blackberry was recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process and rust was researched as and agent, although it has has largely been ineffective across the range. Beer & Morin (2005) stated that Biological control (eg the rust fungus) is particularly useful in large inaccessible areas (Beer & Morin 2005).

Seeds generally germinate during the autumn months. Seedlings form a rosette during autumn and winter and finally flower during spring and summer. The stimulus for flowering is a combination of summer moisture, rosette size and vernalisation (exposure to a period of low temperatures). The rosettes may not flower, but pass the winter to flower in the following year. The plant dies after flowering, but seeds may stay attached until the following spring, delaying germination for a year (CRC 2003).",

    "controlMethods": "Considerable research and effort has been made into the control of Boneseed. As a result a range of effective control measures are available, including chemical, physical and biological control methods, also incorporating the use of fire. Because of the large and persistent seed-banks in the soil, long-term control will mean that areas have to be treated repeatedly for several years (CRC 2003). Prevention of infestation in the first instance is clearly a priority. Any Boneseed plants in gardens should be destroyed since they represent a seed source and hence potential for further spread (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: Chemicals (herbicides) can be used to control bone seed with 4 main methods used.\n\n1. Cut-and-swab method where herbicide is applied to the stump of a felled plant.\n\n2. Stem injection method where herbicide is injected in the sapwood of the plant in the main stem.\n\n3. Foliar spray method where the leaves of the plant are sprayed with a herbicide solution.\n\n4. Splatter gun application method where\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the four methods.\n\nPhysical control: Because of its shallow root system with no large taproot, seedlings and young plants can be pulled out by hand. Larger plant may be able to be hand pulled in damp moist soil or in sandy soil. This is not possible in heavier drier soils and the use of hand tools is required to leaver plants out of the ground (e.g. the tree popper).\n\nBiological control: Boneseed has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. Attempts at biological control of Boneseed not been hugely successful so far (Brougham et al. 2006). Boneseed has been targeted for biological control but the control agents already released, including the tip moth Comostolopsis and the seed fly Mesoclanis, have failed to establish successfully. The leaf buckle mite Aceria and the rust Endophyllum osteospermi appear more promising agents. Natural regeneration or over-sowing with locally collected seed of native species can be an important part of the rehabilitation process (CRC 2003).\n\nSee the link below for detailed information on planning for and undertaking control of Boneseed as seen in ‘Boneseed Management Manual’ (available at https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/research-and-publications/publications-search/boneseed-management-manual-current-management-and-control-options-for-boneseed).",

Seeds germinate at any time of the year but mostly in autumn. An individual plant can produce 50 000 seeds a year and about 60% of seeds are viable. The hard seed coat splits open in some and these germinate as soon as there is enough soil moisture. In many seeds however, the seed coat remains intact and seeds can remain viable in the soil for more than ten years (CRC 2003).",

Branched Broomrape is banned in many countries of the world (Scher undated).",
    "controlMethods": "Broomrapes are species targeted for national eradication under the National Resource Management Ministerial Council's National Cost-Sharing Eradication Programmes. These programmes map and monitor the full distribution of the species, and coordinate or undertake activities to eradicate that species from Australia.\n\nEffective control has meant that there has to be an understanding of the biology of Branched Broomrape. Such a programme has been underway since 2002 (Matthews et al. 2006). There is still some confusion surrounding the name which should be applied to the introduced South Australian material (W.R.Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nNon-chemical control: In order to control the outbreak of Branched Broomrape in South Australia the region affected has been placed under quarantine to prevent spread of the weed outside the infected area by livestock and machinery. Legislation and protocols pertaining to the quarantine area is documented in the Code of the Minister for Environment & Conservation (2003). Grain harvesters and other farm machinery must be decontaminated, crops must be inspected before harvest, and movement of grain, straw and livestock is controlled to try to contain the infestation.\n\nVarious means aimed at reducing the seedbank of Broomrape within the soil have been tested. These have included fumigation with methyl bromide and Basamid and studies of Interceptor, a product derived from Pinus pulp (Williams et al. 2006). The other method being trialled is \"suicide germination\" where Broomrape seeds are stimulated to germinate by artificial means rather than by the presence of a trigger from a host (Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity Conservation SA 2007; Virtue et al. 2006). Other techniques for reducing the soil seedbank such as solarisation, trap crops etc. are documented in Virtue & Jupp (2002).",
    "bestControlSeason": "It is thought that specific substances are required to be secreted by the host root before broomrape seeds will germinate. Further triggers are then needed to begin the formation of the haustorium by the broomrape seed. The haustorium is the attachment between the broomrape plant and its host and is the means by which the broomrape plant obtains its moisture and food. Disruption of triggers at this stage of development are some of the ways in which it has been attempted to control the growth of broomrape species (Cooke 2002).\n\nIn the presence of appropriate triggers, moisture for a week and a soil temperature between 18 and 23°C, Broomrape seeds are able to germinate and parasitise the roots of the host for up to 50 days. Stems appear in September/October with flowering and fruiting occurring very shortly after. Dried-out plants may persist for some time. Above-ground plants usually only represent a small part of any infestation (Faithfull & McLaren 2004).",

None is native to Australia.\n\nCabomba is native to eastern USA, southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and north-eastern Argentina (Stanley & Orchard 2007). It has been spread throughout the world by the aquarium trade (CRC 2003) and is now naturalised, usually from discarded aquarium plants, in many countries, including Australia and New Guinea (Stanley & Orchard 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Once established, Cabomba is extremely difficult to control, so prevention is therefore the best means of control. This requires community awareness for early detection and notification of any stands. The spread of Cabomba in Australia has also been aided by the deliberate ‘seeding’ of waterways to ensure a wild supply for the aquarium trade (CRC 2003). Some strategies to help prevent spread include the following:\n\nDispose of Cabomba from aquariums responsibly, e.g., by drying and burning the entire plant.\nEducate people to use other species of aquarium plants\nLocal agencies need to be able to close waterways to prevent spread\nDevelop protocols for washdown of boats, trailers and fishing equipment before they leave an infested site (CRC 2003).\n\nPhysical control: cutting and removal is suited to accessible areas of closed water bodies with established heavy infestations. However, Cabomba grows so quickly that treatment is only likely to maintain a clear water surface for a few weeks and the cost is high. Hand pulling by divers is best suited to isolated plants and small areas (CRC 2003).\n\nThe deliberate lowering of the water level (drawdown) may be the best option for drinking water supplies. If the base of the water storage dries out completely there is little chance of Cabomba surviving, but if it remains damp there is a more than 50% chance it will return. Because Cabomba requires direct sunlight, shading has been used to kill it in small areas. However, the cost is prohibitive for large-scale programs. Long-term benefits are expected from maintaining tree coverage along the edges of creeks and rivers to discourage Cabomba establishing in the shallows (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: is difficult because of the problems associated with applying chemicals in water and the potential to affect non-target species. It has also shown some resistance to herbicides (CRC 2003). See the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information at http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nBiological control: has not yet been attempted although some research has been conducted (Mackey & Swarbrick 1998, Julien & Schooler 2004).

Gray) is currently led by CSIRO Australia and supported by the Rural Research and Development for Profit program in Australia (Harvey et al., 2023).\n\nFor further information see CRC (2003) and the NRETA (undated).",

    "controlMethods": "African Boxthorn (Lycium ferocissimum) is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS) in Australia due to its invasiveness, impacts, potential for spread and effects on socio-economic and environmental values. Several chemical and mechanical control methods are effective for managing African Boxthorn.\n\nChemical control: Chemicals (herbicides) can be used to control African Boxthorn.\n\nFoliar sprays: can be applied when the plants are actively growing in spring or after rain when the plant is actively growing with follow-up in autumn. As the plant has a remarkably resilient rootstock, and will readily shed its leaves when under stress, foliar spraying does not produce such reliable results as it does for some other weed species.\n\nBasal bark treatment:  spraying around the base of stems for plant up to around 50 mm in diameter to a height of 30-40 cm above ground level.\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface.\n\nRoot application: is when a residual herbicide can be applied to the soil between the base of the plant and the drip-line, usually when the soil is wet or rain is expected (Land Protection 2006), and is normally used where there are no native plants to be affected.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au , DPI NSW (2019) and (Noble and Rose 2013).\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nPhysical control:  Manual (hand) removal is only possible when plants are small seedlings. Some Mechanical (machine removal) control of African Boxthorn is possible but there is likely to be re-growth from soil seed stores or from the taproot, meaning that cultivation and/or herbicides may need to be the next step. Mechanical control of Boxthorn is best done when the plant is not carrying fruit or seed; otherwise, fresh seed is likely to be deposited into freshly disturbed soil. Suitable mechanical techniques for managing African Boxthorn include the following:\n\nWinching – involves pulling or winching (for example with a tractor and chain) can be used to remove large plants in difficult-to-access or fragile areas (such as coastal dunes).\n\nPulling or plucking – involves grabbing and lifting the plants mechanically with a front-end loader, articulated loader or excavator and is useful for treating light to moderate infestations and minimises impacts on surrounding vegetation.\n\nDozing, stick raking and blade ploughing – are most suitable for moderate to heavy African Boxthorn infestations where the risk of damaging non-target vegetation on production lands is not a concern.\n\nCultivation – In areas that are to be used for pasture or crops, after physically removing the African Boxthorn, cultivation can be a useful technique. It will break up roots remaining in the soil and bring root fragments to the surface, where they will dry out and/or should be raked and burned. Follow-up vigorous native perennial pastures compete with African Boxthorn. Establish pastures as soon as possible after weed removal. Consult an agronomist for advice on pasture establishment and management for your location.\n\nMachine-based cut stump – Another option is machine-based cut-stump control, which involves cutting the plant near its base then immediately applying herbicide.\n\nDisposal:  With each of the above techniques, African Boxthorn bushes should be piled and burnt.\n\nFollow-up: Return to the site and treat regrowth from the roots or plant base with herbicide, and hand pull, cut and paint, or spray seedlings. Follow-up will be required until there is no more regrowth or seed germination.\n\nBiological control: CSIRO has undertaken research that focuses on identifying which of the many natural enemies that attack African boxthorn in the native range of South Africa are the most appropriate candidate biological control agents for this weed (CSIRO 2015-2020). This research on African boxthorn has been part of the projects ‘Biocontrol solutions for sustainable management of weed impacts to agricultural profitability’ (2016-2020) and ‘Underpinning agricultural productivity and biosecurity by weed biological control‘ (2019-2022), led by AgriFutures Australia (the trading name of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC)).

    "origin": "Perennial Thistle is native in Europe, western Asia (i.e. Eurasia) and northern Africa (Navie 2004; GRIN 2007). It is now widely naturalised in climatically temperate parts of the world, and a serious and troublesome agricultural weed in many countries including many of those where it is a native species (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",
    "controlMethods": "For Perennial Thistle (Cirsium arvense), as with all thistles the best means of control is to prevent initial establishment. With Perennial Thistle this means maintaining good quality pasture free from bare areas as germination is always more successful on open sites. Once an infestation is established control is problematic because of the rhizomatous nature of the plant. An integrated approach using a combination of strategies is likely to be the most effective (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nChemical control: Although the top growth Perennial Thistle is susceptible to many herbicides, long term control is difficult to obtain, as it is with most deep rooted perennials. Herbicide applications can be effective if the right herbicide is chosen and applied at the right time. As with other thistle species, seedlings are the most susceptible growth stage and provided the plants are growing vigorously, treatment should be applied as soon as germination is complete. Care should be taken to differentiate between seedlings and rosettes that have regrown from root stock as the response to control methods are different. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-Chemical control:  Cultivation of infested areas is not advised because this fragments the rhizome and can seriously spread the problem by moving roots with vegetative buds to new areas. The only exception to this is if the ground can be repeatedly cultivated every couple of weeks to totally prevent emergence of any shoots until the root system is exhausted. It is though that over about a year the root system will die. However, it generally at least two to three years are required. In the mean time the land is out of production and this method could also contribute to soil erosion and a breakdown of the soil structure (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Pasture species which grow actively in summer, such as lucerne and phalaris, are good competitors and can out-compete Perennial Thistle especially when combined with regular mowing (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Parsons & Cuthbertson (1992) also comment that studies in New Zealand have suggested that goat grazing can be very damaging to Perennial Thistle.\n\nBiological Control: Perennial Thistle has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. However, Biological control involving a rust fungus and Puccinia punictiformis and native aphids have been known to restrict its spread but do not offer long term control (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nFor further information on control and management of Perennial Thistle see: DiTomaso &  Kyser (2013); DPI NSW (2020) and DPIRD (2020);  Parsons & Cuthbertson (1992); TPIPWE (2019).",
    "bestControlSeason": "New seedlings germinate in spring or autumn and produce a vertical taproot and a rosette of leaves. The vertical taproot after two months, then produces lateral roots that eventually arch down vertically again. These lateral roots produce with growing points (rhizomes) produce areal shots at the point of the arch, with these vegetative shoots (plants). New vegetative shoots develop in late winter and early spring (or summer in Tasmania) and plants develop a dense growth of rosettes during springs.  The plants produces continues to produce extensive lateral creeping roots (rhizomes).\n\nFlowering stems then develop from well established rosettes in later spring with flowering occurring in summer. Some plants flower in their first year but this is not common. Plants die off after flowering and seed is shed from the female plants, apparently affected by frost, but the roots bearing vegetative buds survive to re-infest the area as the weather starts to warm up (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nSeed storage in the soil is reported to be for as long as 21 years for at least a small percentage of the seed produced.

    "origin": "The native distribution of Caltrop (Tribulus terrestris) is obscure and the species is very much in need of a global revision. It is generally accepted that it is native to southern Europe and northern Africa but the plant is now so widely spread that this is not certain. It may have originated in the Saharan region, and spread into the Mediterranean region (Squires 1979, cited in Guertin, 2005). However only global DNA studies are likely to be able to suggest where it might have originally been native (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "controlMethods": "Caltrop (Tribulus terrestris) produces large number of seeds per plant and their continuous germination (viability) over a number of years control of Caltrop may be difficult. The prime aim in control has to be reducing the number of seeds produced, reducing the number of seeds stored within the soil and stopping seed dispersal. Watch out for new outbreaks and weed out individual plants as they emerge. If coming from an infested area, be sure to remove any nutlets from footwear, tyres and clothing to prevent further spread (Naughton & Bourke 2005).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides are most effective at the seedling stage (Parson & Cuthbertson 2001). Application of a registered herbicide via foliar spry is effective. However, any fruits present may contain viable seed. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical removal: small seedlings can be hand-pulled and any fruit removed from larger plants  placed in a bag and disposed of in a bin or they could be dried and then burnt, if permitted by local council by-laws.\n\nMechanical control: Use a prickle roller, matting, foam rubber etc. to pick up mature fruits and dispose of them. Encouraging summer ground cover provides competition for seedlings\n\nGrazing: Caltrop is favoured by bare areas caused by overgrazing or drought.\n\nCultivation and management: Re-establish ground cover once control has been achieved. Pasture management or renovation to provide competition is often the key to caltrop control in pasture.  Mulching or maintaining a dense turf are the best options to prevent establishment.\n\nHygiene: prevention is the best form, of control. Make sure that any hay, produce, stock, soil and machinery brought onto any property is free of any nutlets.\n\nBiological control: Caltrop has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. There are a number of native species of Tribulus in Australia and so any potential biological control agents must be carefully tested (Barker 2007, pers. comm.). The larvae of a Native Moth (Ephysteris subdiminutella ferritincta) have been found to attack the seeds of Caltrop, but even though the level of infestation may be quite high, the overall impact of the insect is low. In California Caltrop is apparently controlled by the Stem Weevil (Microlarinus lypriformis) and seed weevil (M. lareynii), introduced from Italy as biocontrol agents in 1961 (Encycloweedia 2005; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Caltrop (Tribulus terrestris) is usually an annual plant germinating after each rain event in late spring and summer. In more northerly and inland areas it is possible that the rootstock is perennial and germination events are more opportunistic. A deep root system is quickly established allowing Caltrop to survive prolonged dry conditions.\n\nCaltrop has seeds that remain dormant in the soil for probably four to five years. They germinate after summer rain and plants grow rapidly, flowering within three weeks of germination and forming new burrs within three to five weeks to six weeks. Individual flowers only last a single day but flowering is usually continuous until there is a decline in temperature with the onset of autumn or if the plant dies. Plants are killed by frosts. Fruit are produced continually throughout this time and it has been estimated that more than a 1 000 seeds can be produced by a single plant; other estimates for the United States give figures of 200-5,000 fruits per plant (Guertin 2003). Buried seed remains viable for many years (Naughton & Bourke 2005).",

Using herbicides near waterways raises concerns about impact on non-target plants and the environmental health of the waterway (CRC 2003a; Ensbey 2004). Please see the DPI NSW WeedWise site for herbicide options for NSW: https://weeds.dpi.nsw.gov.au/Weeds/AlligatorWeed#biosecurity.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: The value of physical controls (hand-pulling  or manual) is limited to small and isolated situations and could be particularly useful in removing initial invaders of a catchment if they can be located early enough. Mechanical control: Excavation of a small infestation will require at least the removal of 1-2 metres of soil from beneath the plant to ensure all root material is removed. However, other advice states that excavations should only be made to a depth of 20 cm due to the sheer volume of contaminated soil to be disposed of. An excavated site is then inspected regularly for signs of regrowth, which are then either treated with herbicide or removed by deep manual digging, depending on the management aim. Mechanical removal, particularly in waterways, is problematic and may contribute to downstream spread. Cultivation or slashing: Once alligator weed is established on land it cannot be controlled by cultivation or slashing. Any cultivation or slashing of infested land will only spread the infestation further as stem fragments root in soil or water and must be removed.  Councils and landowners in all states and territory may require a permit to remove and transport Alligator Weed.\n\nDisposal: The disposal of the collected material poses specific problems and material must be treated and disposed of securely. Plant material can be dried and incinerated, boiled or microwaved. Do not dispose of alligator weed in green waste or composting facilities. Large volumes of excavated contaminated soil are difficult to process, and if possible need to be spread on an impenetrable surface and dried prior to burial (preferably sealed in containers) at a secure disposal site that can be monitored for any signs of regrowth. Machine hygiene is essential when performing physical control to avoid accidental re-introduction or spread to new areas.\n\nBiological control: Alligator Weed was recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allowed activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. As a biological control the Flea Beetle (Agasicles hygrophila) was first introduced to Australia in 1976. It provides good control in aquatic environments in the Sydney region. Over the years floating mats of Alligator Weed has been successfully reduced the area of in the Georges River and in parts of the Hawkesbury Nepean system. This is a truly aquatic insect and is only effective in warm temperate and sub tropical areas that allow it to breed up to high numbers in early summer. One criticism of the flea beetle is the tendency for Alligator Weed to fragment when under attack, causing downstream spread. Plant fragments should be contained if downstream spread is an issue in areas where the flea beetles are active (NSW DPI 2019). A moth (Arcola malloi) contributes to control in aquatic habitats and is established but, like the Flea Beetle, has no impact on terrestrial Alligator Weed (Ensbey 2004). The role of these agents is therefore limited to ongoing suppression of extensive aquatic infestations. Biological control is not appropriate for eradication strategies. Further biological control programs are being explored (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nAlligator Weed has rarely, if ever, been successfully eradicated once it has infested a water body, despite numerous costly attempts. There has been some success with small infestations on land in suburban backyards. The highest priority for the management of Alligator Weed in Australia is an effective system of early detection and eradication before infestations become established. Management plans for large infestations of Alligator Weed should aim to contain and reduce population size, and prevent spread and establishment of new populations. Weed spreads so readily from fragments, and control methods are varied depending on site and size of population, so please contact your local council or state or territory weed management agency for advice (CRC 2003a).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Alligator Weed can survive in tropical and sub-tropical regions such as Darwin and Brisbane, and cooler climates such as Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.\n\nIn tropical to sub-tropical regions growth can be year round.\n\nIn cooler regions, temperature is an important factor affecting growth with peak growth occurring in summer. Alligator Weed increases or starts growing again during warmer periods, normally in spring. New stems formed in spring grow quickly during summer, producing flowers by midsummer. Flowering continues until March when the weather becomes cooler and the days shorter and growth slows. In winter, growth is often limited by frosts whereas in aquatic habitats growth can continue slowly. In winter, leaves drop off terrestrial plants and those exposed stems of aquatic plants, and frost kills most of the exposed vegetation. However, some roots, rhizomes and protected stems survive over winter and allows it to regenerate during the warmer months with growth starting again during the following spring (CRC 2003a).\n\nGrowth in aquatic areas always exceeds terrestrial growth. At terrestrial sites, cold, moisture stress, limited nutrients, and competition with species growing nearby limits growth. No viable seed is produced.",

    "controlMethods": "Control of Cape Broom (Genista monspessulana) is possible by chemical, mechanical, and biological means. However, when mature flowering plants are removed, many seedlings will germinate from the soil seed bank and  long term follow-up is critical. Integrated control methods (combining control techniques over time), with long term follow-up is advised for control success. Preventing spread in new areas is the best form of control and weed hygiene should always be employed. A long-term strategic program is required to effectively control Cape Broom concentrating on exhausting the large, long-lived seed-bank and preventing further additions to it. New infestations should be treated prior to plants reaching the flowering stage. Once plants start to produce seeds control becomes more difficult and dispersal to other areas is likely. Treated areas should be regularly checked for regeneration, particularly after fire and soil disturbance.\n\nChemical control: Larger plants can be cut and painted with a suitable herbicide. Smaller plants can be slashed to control their regeneration and any regrowth sprayed with a suitable herbicide. Various herbicide are effective and available for use, please see, Office of Environment and Heritage (2014)  and DPI NSW (2019) for further details. Herbicide application methods are:\n\nFoliar spraying: For the application of herbicide solution to weed foliage in the form of a spray, a common method used for woody plants. Foliar spraying can be used to treat plants of all ages but can be less effective on older plants.\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface killing the plant to prevent regeneration from the rootstock.\n\nBasal barking: This method involves applying herbicide mixed with an adjuant to the lower trunk or stem of woody plants up to around 50 mm in diameter to a height of 30-40 cm above ground level.\n\nStem injection (drill-and-fill): Stem injection delivers herbicide directly to the sapwood but is rarely used on brooms, but when used, it is for plants with stems over 50 mm in circumference.\n\nScrape-and-paint: This method involves scraping away a small section of the bark and applying herbicide directly onto the sapwood. It is an effective but rarely used technique normally used on larger plants.\n\nSplatter or gas gun:  splatter guns were developed over thirty five years ago for sheep drenching and has been adapted for weed spraying using chemicals.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Control methods are described in detail in Office of Environment and Heritage (2014).\n\nPhysical control:  Seedlings and smaller plants can be dug out with small tools, or pulled out by hand, preferably when the ground is moist and soft. This is normally used in new infestations that have not flowered or in area after mature plants have been removed, and this type follow-up removes the many new seedlings that would have subsequently germinated. Older senescent broom plants can be cut at or below ground level, sometimes without the subsequent use of herbicide as they usually do not re-sprout or coppice at that stage of their life cycle.\n\nMechanical control: Removal by clearing is a useful method of controlling large infestations of Cape Broom. Crushing, mechanical pulling plants, or slashing with machinery clears areas ready for follow-up control methods required when mass of germination of Cape Broom seedlings will occurs from the soil seed-bank.\n\nMulching: Mulching or grooming with a tractor or excavator-mounted mulcher cuts bushes off at ground level and processes them to fine mulch. The mulch provides some suppression of seedling growth leaving a cleaner site after control than some other mechanical methods.\n\nCultivation: Cultivation with disc or mouldboard ploughs is useful for breaking established roots and for follow-up treatment of seedlings and regrowth in large infestations.\n\nCompetition and management: Stock availability, adequate fencing and the establishment of strong pasture grasses are the keys to using grazing to improve broom management.\n\nFire:  Most adult plants are killed by fire, but some are capable of re-sprouting from the rootstock. Although the amount of soil-stored seed may be reduced by burning, effective control of Cape Broom can only be achieved by regular treatment of regenerating seedlings by hand-pulling or herbicide application for 3 to 5 years following fire (Muyt 2001; Department of Primary Industries Victoria 2004, Australian Weeds Committee 2011). Soil-stored seed is stimulated to germinate following fire and may continue to germinate for many years following burning.\n\nBiological control: Cape Broom has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. A number of biological agents have been identified (Department of Primary Industries Victoria 2004; Sheppard & Henry 2012).

In planning such programs integrated management strategies will achieve the best results. Early treatment of new infestations and small patches should be a priority. Control is complicated by dormancy of the corms and seeds. Only a limited proportion of plants grow in any one season. Control of these plants will not affect dormant corms. Any control program in agricultural situations should commence with cultivation or burning in late summer or early autumn to encourage the sprouting of dormant corms (Funston & Faithfull 1999).\n\nSingle individuals and small numbers of plants should be dug out and the corms and fruit destroyed by burning or immersion in boiling water (Funston & Faithfull 1999).\n\nManual control: Cultivation is an effective method of control during a very short period when the plant is in the 'corm transition stage'. This occurs when the old corms have shrivelled appreciably and the new corm at the base of the stem is not yet fully developed. The corm transition stage lasts approximately two weeks and usually occurs in June or July, with variation from year to year. Cultivate to a depth of at least 15 cm or to the depth of the deepest corm to kill most plants. Repeat after four weeks to kill surviving plants and again when necessary for at least four years until the dormant seeds and corms are exhausted (Funston & Faithfull 1999).\n\nChemical control: Cape Tulip can be effectively and economically controlled with herbicide treatment repeated over several seasons. It is most effective when the plant is just about to flower or has just begun to flower. Treatment must be undertaken annually to reduce the population of Cape Tulip.

    "origin": "The actual native range of Golden Dodder is obscure. It is thought to be native to North America (Canada, USA and Mexico) and parts of the Caribbean (i.e., the Bahamas, Cuba, Guadeloupe, Jamaica and Martinique). It is possibly also native to parts of South America (GRIN 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Golden Dodder is a difficult weed to eradicate, or even manage effectively, because its seed can survive for long periods in the soil and it can commence seed production after only a few weeks of growth.\n\nNon-chemical control: Prevention of introduction and spread is vital and this is best done with good quarantine measures. Contaminated pasture seed is an important source of new infestations, so it is essential to only use certified pasture seeds. Contaminated hay and grain can also introduce Golden Dodder to properties or to clean areas, so any contaminated fodder should be destroyed. Livestock and contaminated machinery can also spread the seed to new areas. Machinery should be cleaned before moving to other paddocks and stock grazing on areas known to be infested with Golden Dodder should be kept in quarantine for at least two days before they are moved to Dodder-free pastures. Control of weeds that are the preferred hosts for Golden Dodder, such as Noogoora and Bathurst Burrs (Xanthium spp.) will also reduce its chance of spreading and prevent them from becoming sources of infestation (Trounce et al. 1998).\n\nPhysical control: Golden Dodder can be controlled by cutting the host plant as close as possible to ground level and burning it. Do not slash infested areas, as this will promote the spread of Dodder.\n\nLand management: Crops or pastures that are severely infested (e.g., Lucerne and Clover) should be replaced or rotated with less susceptible or resistant crops or pastures where practical. Less susceptible species include cereal crops (e.g., Wheat, Barley, Oats, Triticale and Cereal Rye), summer grain crops (e.g., Maize and Sorghum) and perennial pasture grasses. Where crops or pastures are used in rotations to control Golden Dodder, lucerne or susceptible legumes should not be sown again for at least five years (Trounce et al. 1998).\n\nEarly detection is necessary if Golden Dodder is to be controlled before seeding commences. Therefore, all workers on at risk or infested farms should be made aware of Golden Dodder and be able to identify it. Vigilance is also required after control measures have been taken, as it is easy to overlook the small threads starting to invade again. Threads as small as 5 cm can re-attach to the host crop and continue the infestation (Trounce et al. 1998).\n\nChemical control: Although no selective herbicides are available for use, contact herbicides can be used to rapidly desiccate the standing crop and destroy the Dodder plants. Contact herbicides act by quickly killing green plant material and do not harm crop roots or seeds below the soil surface. Where Golden Dodder infestations occur in non-crop areas, it can be eradicated by control with non-selective herbicides (Trounce et al. 1998).\n\nCheck with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for Golden Dodder control. Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",
    "bestControlSeason": "Seeds can germinate in spring, summer and autumn, but most germination takes place in late spring. However, germination will not occur without stimulus provided by the close presence of a suitable host plant. This is because seedlings do not possess roots and will die unless they quickly become attached to a host plant. By parasitising the host plant, the seedlings are able to twine rapidly and quickly commence flowering (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Flowering occurs mostly in spring and early summer and is closely followed by seed production (Navie 2004). Seeds have a hard coat and can remain dormant in the soil for several years (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

Remove all stem parts from the ground as they will take root and regrow. If removal from site is difficult ensure vines are placed off the ground (on branches or a platform) to dry out and decompose. Alternatively, seal in strong bags and dispose as rubbish.\n\nMulching may be an effective choice for smaller infestations when herbicides are not appropriate. Cover the entire infestation with several inches of mulch. This may include wood chips, grass clippings, hay or similar degradable plant material. Shredded or chipped wood may be the best option since hay and grass may potentially carry weed seeds. Covering the area with cardboard may improve the effectiveness and longevity of this method. The mulch should stay in place for at least two growing seasons and may need to be augmented several times. Mulching can also be done following herbicide treatment.\n\nMechanical control: Vines climbing up into the tree canopy are more difficult to manage and should be cut to a comfortable height to kill upper portions and relieve the tree canopy.\n\nChemical control: Because it is an evergreen vine and remains active during the winter, herbicide applications can be made at any time of year as long as temperatures are above 12 or 15 degrees Celsius for a few days.

Based on his work most Australian material would agree more closely with A. gangetica subsp. gangetica in having flowers more than 25 mm long. However material collected in New South Wales represents the more aggressive form of this species, subsp. micrantha, which has a flower length of less than 25 mm, although flower size is not always reliable in Australian material (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "controlMethods": "As Asystasia gangetica [as A. gangetica subsp. micrantha] is not currently widespread the most efficient method of control is early detection and eradication. Small infestations can be easily eradicated if they are detected early but an ongoing commitment is needed to ensure new infestations do not establish. Management of the soil seedbank is particularly important and follow up over a number of years is the key to managing infestations (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: Some herbicides are available to treat A. gangetica [as A. gangetica subsp. micrantha] infestations. As maintaining groundcover and competitive desirable species is important, always get advice before spraying. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand weeding is a suitable approach for small infestations. Extreme care must be taken to ensure correct disposal of plant material. Much of the spread of A. gangetica [as A. gangetica ssp. micrantha] has been attributed to the incorrect disposal of plant parts which can contain seeds and broken stems which readily establish and form new plants, causing the infestation to spread. The best disposal methods which will kill seeds cheaply and easily are still being investigated (CRC 2003).\n\nSlashing prior to seed set may help control A. gangetica [as A. gangetica ssp. micrantha]. However, equipment must be carefully cleaned to prevent further spread. Cultivation should also be avoided (CRC 2003).\n\nFire and biological control are not currently part of the control strategy for A. gangetica. However, revegetation may be helpful as competition from other vegetation can help suppress seedling germination. Planting alternative indigenous groundcovers and avoiding bare ground wherever possible can help prevent A. gangetica [as A. gangetica ssp. micrantha] taking hold (CRC 2003).\n\nAny new outbreaks should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council.

Treatment should occur when the plants are young , when they can be easily removed or are susceptible to herbicides. Mature plants are persistent and difficult to eradicate (Western Australian Herbarium 1998-).\n\nChemical control: Spot spraying should be carried out on actively growing young plants before they elongate and reach flowering stage, preferably with a selective woody weed herbicide. If the plants are growing near sensitive vegetation, they can be treated by the cut and paint method in winter-spring before new growth emerges. Make the cut close to the base or plants will re-sprout. Dense infestations can be slashed or burnt in winter to provide access for spraying in spring. Wild Fennel may sometimes be harvested by people for culinary use, so if spraying in public places, use a dye in the spray, and place a sign indicating that the plants have been sprayed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Follow up control of seedlings is required. Combination of burning followed by spraying may be effective for mature plants.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Removing individuals of small plants or infestations of fennel is recommended with young plants hand chipped. To avoid cultivated forms of fennel becoming weed escapees remove spent flower heads before seed set. Fennel roots and foliage should be disposed of in hot composts to avoid unintentional vegetative or seed propagation (McFarlane 2007).  However, care should be taken if digging out mature large plants as Fennel is deep rooted, it can regrow from pieces left after cultivation.\n\nMechanical control: Slashing just before flowering may kill the plants, or repeat slashing of regrowth may be needed. At worst, slashing stems at flowering time will prevent seed set and buy a little time before the whole plant needs to be treated. .\n\nCompetition and management: Does not normally occur in healthy well managed pastures.

    "controlMethods": "Given that Flax-leaf Broom (Genista linifolia) is possible by chemical, mechanical, and biological means.  As flax-leaf Broom is closely related to the genus Cytisus, the control methods applied for Cytisus scoparius, C. multiflorus, and Cape Broom (Genista monspessulana) can be used to control or eradicate Genista linifolia (Muyt 2001).\n\nIt is very important to control isolated young plants should be controlled before they set seed to prevent the establishment of a soil seed bank (Australian Weeds Committee 2011). Because of the longevity of the soil-stored seeds of Flax-leaf Broom and other Genista species, which can remain dormant for at ten years (or more), eliminating larger infestations should be approached as a long-term endeavour (Muyt 2001).\n\nSeeds of Genista species usually fail to establish in dense shade. As such creating any soil disturbance will normally induce a mass germination of soil stored seeds, which may continue to germinate for a number of years. In established infestations of Genista, seed numbers can reach several thousand per square metre (Muyt 2001).\n\nChemical control: Various herbicide are effective and available for use, please see, Office of Environment and Heritage (2014)  and DPI NSW (2019) for further details. Herbicide application methods are:\n\nFoliar spraying: Foliar herbicide spraying is the application of herbicide solution to weed foliage in the form of a spray, a common method used for woody plants. Foliar herbicide spray can be applied to control Flax-leaf Broom, but follow-up treatments of re-growth of mature plants are necessary. Smaller plants can be slashed to control their regeneration and any regrowth sprayed with a suitable herbicide. Furthermore, damage to native plants should be minimised Australian Weeds Committee 2011).\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface killing the plant to prevent regeneration from the rootstock.\n\nBasal barking: Herbicide can be applied to the bark of smaller stems. This method involves applying herbicide mixed with an adjuant to the lower trunk or stem of woody plants up to around 50 mm in diameter to a height of 30-40 cm above ground level.\n\nStem injection (drill-and-fill): Herbicide can be injected into the bark of larger stems (Australian Weeds Committee 2011). Stem injection delivers herbicide directly to the sapwood but is rarely used on brooms, but when used, it is for plants with stems over 50 mm in circumference.\n\nScrape-and-paint: This method involves scraping away a small section of the bark and applying herbicide directly onto the sapwood. It is an effective but rarely used technique normally used on larger plants.\n\nSplatter or gas gun:  splatter guns were developed over thirty five years ago for sheep drenching and has been adapted for weed spraying using chemicals.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Control methods are described in detail in Office of Environment and Heritage (2014). Non-chemical methods are usually followed up with chemical (herbicide) applications.\n\nPhysical control:  Seedlings and smaller plants can be dug out with small tools, or pulled out by hand, preferably when the ground is moist and soft. Hand weeding or hoeing is an option for where there are only isolated plants. This is normally used in new infestations that have not flowered or in area after mature plants have been removed, and this type follow-up removes the many new seedlings that would have subsequently germinated. Older senescent broom plants can be cut at or below ground level, sometimes without the subsequent use of herbicide as they usually do not re-sprout or coppice at that stage of their life cycle.\n\nMechanical control: Bulldozing and then burning has been used for larger infestations of Cytisus scoparius (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Removal by clearing is a useful method of controlling large infestations of Cape Broom. Crushing, mechanical pulling plants, or slashing with machinery clears areas ready for follow-up control methods required when mass of germination of Cape Broom seedlings will occurs from the soil seed-bank.\n\nMulching: Mulching or grooming with a tractor or excavator-mounted mulcher cuts bushes off at ground level and processes them to fine mulch. The mulch provides some suppression of seedling growth leaving a cleaner site after control than some other mechanical methods.\n\nCultivation: Cultivation with disc or mouldboard ploughs is useful for breaking established roots and for follow-up treatment of seedlings and regrowth in large infestations.\n\nCompetition and management: Stock availability, adequate fencing and the establishment of strong pasture grasses are the keys to using grazing to improve broom management.\n\nFire:  Most adult plants are killed by fire, but some are capable of re-sprouting from the rootstock. Although the amount of soil-stored seed may be reduced by burning, effective control can only be achieved by regular treatment of regenerating seedlings by hand-pulling or herbicide application for 3 to 5 years following fire (Muyt 2001; Department of Primary Industries Victoria 2004, Australian Weeds Committee 2011). Soil-stored seed is stimulated to germinate following fire and may continue to germinate for many years following burning.\n\nBiological control:  Flax-leaf Broom has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. However, no biological control program has yet been initiated (Australian Weeds Committee 2011).\n\nFor more detailed information on control refer to Parsons & Cuthbertson (1992), Cochrane (2001) and Muyt (2001), Office of Environment and Heritage (2014) and DPI NSW (2019).",

Do not try to control False Yellowhead without expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: False Yellowhead can be sprayed with herbicide. In Western Australia spraying some roadside infestations of False Yellowhead has been encouraging with good kill rates helped by the clumping of plants, although it has been important to spray before seed set. Occasionally, applying herbicide to the stump has been used to treat larger plants. (CRC 2003)\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Before False Yellowhead flowers, isolated plants or small patches can be hand-pulled (wearing gloves), or use a fork to remove plants, minimising soil disturbance. Follow-up manual weeding of previously sprayed patches of any False Yellowhead plants is recommended to minimising disturbance to the soil and reducing the likelihood of germination of False Yellowhead weed seeds in the soil seedbank.\n\nMechanical control: Small areas can be mechanically removed. Plants in flower must be burnt as seed will develop from the nutrient reserves in the stem if left on the ground. In roadside cases some control has been achieved by regular mowing before flowering and seeding. However, protective clothing must be worn because mowing can release the irritating oils that are stored in the leaves (CRC 2003).\nCompetition and management: Cultivation of larger plants is only effective if done before flowering during dry weather. Regrowth often occurs if adequate soil moisture is present.\nAll cut dead plant material in bud or flower can still form seeds if left on the ground after removal. These cut dead plants need to be bagged and dumped, or put in heaps and burned to prevent seed production.",
    "bestControlSeason": "In Australia, flowering takes place between December and April. Germination generally takes place following rainfall and can be quite prolific when fire or mechanical disturbance creates bare ground. Under laboratory conditions, False Yellowhead seeds have been shown to undergo a deep dormancy, which is broken by a lack of light. Seeds of the closely related Stinkwort (Dittrichia graveolens), are viable for about three years (CRC 2003).",

In areas unsuitable for cultivation, such as steep hillsides, seedlings can be heavily grazed by sheep or goats, neither of which has yet shown any ill effects in Australia (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).

    "controlMethods": "In most situations, the most effective and long term control of English Broom will be an integrated weed management program (i.e. a combination of the above methods rather than by reliance on a single method) (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Sainty et al. 1998; Cochrane 2001; Muyt 2001; DPIW 2002).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides are useful for both initial treatment and following other control methods (NSW Weedwise 2018). The most appropriate applications are either foliar spray or cut stump methods (NSW Weedwise 2018). When applying foliar sprays ensure that the mixture is applied to the point of run-off over the whole plant, and use a penetrant or surfactant as directed on the herbicide label (NSW Weedwise 2018). More than one application is usually necessary to be a successful control method.\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual control: For isolated plants of English Broom hand weeding or hoeing is an option. In smaller incursions the cut and paint method can be applied. Bulldozing and then burning larger infestations of English Broom has been used, but this is best avoided unless there are resources for follow-up management. This is only a partial and temporary solution, as this method creates extensive soil disturbance which favours the germination of soil-stored seeds, which will continue to germinate for a number of years. There can be up to 20 000 seeds per square metre in the soil. The advantages are that the adult plants are killed, and the seeds are stimulated to germinate, thus quickening the process of waiting for seeds to germinate so they can be destroyed. Lack of follow-up management, such as spraying the seedlings with herbicide, only exacerbates the problem.\n\nGrazing: Sheep, goats and cattle eat English Broom, particularly younger seedlings, and may suppress the development of infestations. Large plants can be cut to provide stock with better grazing access (SA Natural Resources 2015).\n\nBiological control: English Broom also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. An international biocontrol program involving Australia, New Zealand and the United States has been underway since 1990 to introduce a number of natural enemies to control English Broom. Two biological control agents, the Twig Mining Moth, Leucoptera spartifoliella (Hubner) and the Broom Cud Psyllid, Arytainilla spartiophila (Forster) were released in the north west, west and south of Tasmania in spring 1996 but follow up surveys have indicated these agents have failed to establish (DPIW 2002).\n\nFor more detailed information on control refer to Parsons & Cuthbertson (1992), Cochrane (2001), Muyt (2001) and DPIW (2002).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",

    "controlMethods": "Control of Gorse is possible by chemical, mechanical, ecological and biological means. However, when mature flowering plants are removed, many seedlings will germinate from the soil seed bank and follow-up is critical. Integrated control methods combining techniques, with long term follow-up, is advised for success. Preventing spread in new areas is the best form of control and weed hygiene should always be employed. Where Gorse crosses property boundaries, any eradication efforts should be coordinated with neighbouring landholders to completely destroy all plants in the area and prevent re-infestation. Tackle the small, outlying infestations first. This allows a bigger area of land to be cleaned up first and there will be less follow-up maintenance in these areas as the seedbank will be smaller.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can be applied either directly to leaves when plants are at least 500 mm high or by cut-stump treatment (cut and swab; cut and paint or cut stump methods), where the plant is swan off just above ground level and herbicide is applied to freshly cut stump. Sprays should not be applied when plants are in full flower or when bees are active. A number of herbicides are available for use on Gorse (DPIW 2002; CRC 2003). Foliar sprays normally require complete coverage of actively growing plants, used with a wetting agent, and the plant must be allowed to die over a long period before being removed or burnt. Users of agricultural or veterinary chemical products must always read the label and any permit, before using the product, and strictly comply with the directions on the label and the conditions of any permit (DPI NSW 2019). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand pulling is only possible with small plants and seedlings, normally when the soil is damp and soft allowing easy removal. This is normally used after mature plants have been removed and results in subsequent germination of many seedlings. Mechanical control by clearing is a useful method of controlling large infestations of Gorse using bulldozers or tractors to rip and bulldoze the populations. Regular slashing or mowing is not effective in eradicating Gorse as plants will grow back vigorously once slashing stops (CRC 2003).\n\nCompetition and management: Grazing by sheep is moderately effective for controlling Gorse seedlings before spines are formed but high stocking rates are needed to force sheep to graze on Gorse rather than other pasture species. Grazing needs to be carefully managed to avoid overgrazing and subsequent pasture damage. Burning is often carried out in combination with grazing as it reduces the amount of leaves and stems and stimulates growth of soft green shoots, which are initially spineless and more palatable to stock (CRC 2003).\n\nCultivation: In agricultural situations where stands of gorse has been removed, cultivation with plough can disturb and kill underground roots and is useful for follow-up treatment for killing any regrowth and seedlings. However, some fragments may regrow. Cultivation in cropping is also effective at killing seedlings.\n\nMulching: Can be used to to suppress seedling germination but will not be effective for repressing or killing mature plants cut off at ground level.\n\nFire: Fire can also be useful in reducing dense thickets of Gorse to ground level to allow follow-up with animals or spraying of regrowth and to stimulate seed germination, allowing more seedlings to be sprayed the following year and reducing the seedbank (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Several biological control organisms have been released, including the Gorse Seed Weevil Exapion ulicis, Gorse spider mite Tetranychus lintearius, and Gorse Thrips Sericothrips staphylinus, all with some but limited success. Another thrip (same genus) of Portuguese origin is being reared for field release. A further two agents, a pod moth and soft shoot moth, are also under investigation for potential release into Australia (CRC 2003).\n\nFor further information see the Gorse National Best Practice Manual (available at: https://www.vicgorsetaskforce.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-Gorse-National-Best-Practice-Manual.pdf )",

In cool climates, Gorse may flower only once a year but flowers may be present on some bushes at other times under the right conditions. Seeds are usually released in hot or dry conditions. Individual Gorse bushes can live to a maximum age of about 30 years (CRC 2003).",

    "controlMethods": "Hoary Cress (Lepidium draba) can spread by both seed and more commonly via root fragments although most new plants arise from its spreading roots and broken root segments. Integrated control of Hoary Cress  includes prevention, education, early detection and eradication. Prevention is essential in preventing further outbreaks and spread.  Most successful control efforts combine several management techniques such as herbicide application and physical removal by cultivation, followed by competitive species plantings (Lyons 1998). Its impact was largely curtailed through the incorporation of longer pasture phases in cereal cropping rotations and through the use of more effective herbicides (Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can be used successfully in controlling Hoary Cress. Timing of herbicide applications is critical in achieving desirable results and several years of treatments may be required (DPIW 2002). Numerous treatments area available, see CABI 2021; DPI NSW (2019) Herbiguide (2021).\n\nAlways consult label information and Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Not normally effective as roots with buds left in the soil will re-sprout and regrow.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation alone is neither practical nor sufficient to provide long-term control of Hoary Cress. The most effective control needs to be intensive cultivation carried out on a monthly or fortnightly basis over several years (Mulligan & Findley 1974; Faithfull 1998). Avoid using single cultivation and clean all machinery as as broken root pieces can increase infestations or spread the weed to new locations. Can be controlled via removal by cultivation, but follow-up is normally required.\nCompetition and management: Ensuring thorough cleaning of cultivation, harvesting and road maintenance equipment that has been working in infested areas will help prevent its spread. Hay and crop seeds may also contain seed of Hoary Cress if they have been sourced from infested paddocks. Hoary Cress will persist after, and tolerate heavy grazing; thus it may be used successfully in permanent pasture. Grazing should be timed to prevent seed production in this species and movement of stock that have grazed mature plants and may subsequently transport seed to uninfested areas should be restricted (Agriculture Western Australia 2005; DPIW 2002).",

Erect flowering stems are formed in late winter to early spring and plants flower from September to November.

If plants are disturbed by cultivation in spring or summer, new rosettes are usually formed out of season (Agriculture Western Australia 2005; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; DPIW 2002).

A variety of application methods can be used, including spraying by hand, boom or helicopter. Spraying must be repeated about every three months to control regrowth (CRC 2003).\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical or physical removal is difficult because of Hymenachne’s ability to reproduce vegetatively from very small pieces. Mechanical harvesters have been used to remove Hymenachne and other aquatic weeds from deeper waters in the Burdekin Shire in Queensland, but this requires ongoing control efforts on a monthly basis. In drier regions, constant heavy grazing has been used to remove Hymenachne from ponded pasture systems (Land Protection 2006). Flooding can offer some control, particularly when above-ground Hymenachne vegetation has recently been removed, making it impossible for the plant to keep up with rising water levels (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: There is ongoing research into a biological control agent that will attack the introduced Hymenachne, but not other species such as the closely related native Hymenachne (Hymenachne acutigluma). Most insects found on Hymenachne in Australia are also found on native Hymenachne (Bell et al. 2011). However, a blissid bug (Ischnodemus variegatus) found in invasive Hymenachne populations in Florida seems to be highly specific for this species and hardly affects native Hymenachne (Diaz et al. 2009).\n\nCheck with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for Hymenachne control.

    "bestControlSeason": "Germination of Hymenachne seeds can take place all year round. The seeds require contact with waterlogged, or at least moist, soil for 48 hours before germination can take place (CRC2003). Furthermore, high daytime temperatures, marked differences between day and night temperature and the presence of light induce germination (Wearne et al. 2010). In northern Australia most rainfall occurs between November and March and this is the most likely time for germination. However, seed also survives in water and germinates when water levels recede during the dry season (CRC 2003). Hymenachne seeds also form a long-lived soil seed bank, with about 8-24% of seeds still viable after eight years (Wearne et al. 2010).\n\nHymenachne populations flower mostly between April and July, with a peak of flowering for 1-2 weeks during April and May (Wearne et al. 2008). In southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, flowering is delayed by at least one month. Flowering is normally triggered when day length decreases to less than 12 hours. If enough moisture is available, Hymenachne populations continue to flower at a lower rate throughout the year.  Seed is mostly set from May to July (Wearne et al. 2008; Wearne et al. 2010). As Hymenachne is a perennial, the shoots can brown off if conditions become dry and regrow during the wet season (CRC 2003).",

    "controlMethods": "Control of Onopordum spp. is difficult and therefore time consuming and expensive. The best defence against invasion of Onopordum spp. on agricultural lands is maintaining healthy perennial pasture with good ground cover at all times to prevent seedling establishment. for dense infestations an integrated management program using of a range of tools such as the maintenance of a strong perennial pasture, strategic herbicide application, chipping by hand and use of biological control agents where appropriate is the best strategy for long term control. The key to managing thistles is reduce or prevent plants setting viable seed, and in doing so the following year’s population will be greatly reduced (DPI NSW 2019)\n\nChemical control: Herbicide control of these three Onopordum species can be very effective and is an essential part of the overall management of these thistles and are used on large or dense infestations applying . However, plants can be tricky  to kill  because of the difficulty in wetting the woolly-hairy leaves of the plants. To achieve an effective kill the following should be considered; Timing of application is also important. If a single application of herbicide is undertaken then a springtime application is best (Dellow 1996), as herbicides are most effective on seedlings and young rosettes, Once plants begins stem elongation, herbicides may be less effective; The hairy leaves of the thistles can reduce herbicide effectiveness through reduced absorption. Therefore it is important to follow the herbicide label and use the recommended rate, application volume and adjuvant; Control will be reduced if plants are stressed. When there is a low density of thistles spot spraying  is preferred (DPI NSW 2019). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information available at http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  When there is a low density of thistles hand chipping is effective. Remove as much of the taproot as possible so that regrowth does not occur. Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Slashing or mowing is not usually effective as plants develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Plants can be mown or slashed before flowering to prevent seed set but this is temporary as plants will regrow and develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed and spread seed.\n\nCompetition and management: Pasture management is the most important part of any thistle control program and maintaining a dense, vigorous and competitive, and vigorous perennial grass pasture provides competition for germinating thistles, reducing seedling establishment. Gaps in the pasture result in an increase in thistle germination and seedling survival so maintaining excellent ground cover at all times is desirable (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nWhile thistles respond to increases in soil fertility (and in particular nitrogen), management of all pasture types should aim to maintain pastures that have a good balance of perennial grass to legume content. Fertiliser application (as determined by a soil test) will improve the vigour of annual and perennial introduced grasses, increasing ground cover and reducing future thistle establishment.\n\nThistles are generally avoided by stock. However goats eat thistles at both the rosette and flowering stage as well as post-flowering. Horses, and sometimes cattle graze the flower which can reduce the amount of seed. The amount eaten depends on the grazing pressure and the amount of other feed available (DPI NSW 2019).  With existing infestations of Illyrian Thistle goats are known to be effective in grazing the rosettes, and also the flower-heads once the plant has elongated. This can be a vital step as it reduces seed production and thus limits recruitment of new thistle plants and also reduces the build up of seed in the soil. The soil seedbank is relatively long-lived (Holst & Allan 1996).\n\nBiological control: Onopordum spp. has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control of all three Onopordum thistles discussed here is under study with three insects released into infestations – a seed head weevil, a stem boring weevil and a crown moth the larvae of which attacks leafstalks, the crown of the rosette and also the roots (Dellow & Holtkamp 2005). The following summary is taken from DPI NSW (2019)\n\nSeed-head weevil. The seed-head weevil, Larinus latus, was released in spring 1992. A single larva is capable of destroying all the seed in a flower head of 3 cm diameter or less and more than one larva may develop in larger heads. This weevil has only one generation per year so it has taken a number of years for populations to grow large enough to destroy most of the seed in a flower head. This insect has reduced seed production by more than 80 per cent.\n\nStem-boring weevil. The stem-boring weevil, Lixus cardui, was first released in November 1993 and is now widely established. The stem-boring weevil is not capable of killing Onopordum thistles. Its activity weakens the plant, makes it less competitive and reduces seed production. This action allows insects such as the seed head weevil to have a greater impact on the plant.\n\nCrown moth. The crown moth, Eublemma amoena, was first released in 1998. There are three adult generations per year, commencing in spring when adults emerge from pupal cells in thistle rosettes. Females lay eggs on leaves and larvae feed in the leaf petioles, causing leaves to shrivel and die. Larvae can also bore into the crown and root of the plant. This may lead to the death of smaller plants. Larvae of subsequent generations feed in the leaves of stems, causing similar leaf shriveling, reducing plant vigour.\n\nRosette weevil. The rosette weevil, Trichosirocalus briesei, was first released in 1997. It is now established in many areas and is starting to have an impact on thistle populations. Adults are 3–5 mm long and a mottled brown colour. There is one generation per year. Adults emerge from a summer dormancy period following autumn rains and commence feeding on rosette leaves. Females lay eggs near the base of the rosette leaves. After hatching, larvae destroy the growing point of the rosette either killing the plant or severely reducing its vigour.\n\nFor further information on the control of Onopordum spp. see Keith Turnbull Research Institute (1998), DPI NSW (2008); DPI NSW 2019; DPIW (2002), and the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia (undated);",
    "bestControlSeason": "Scotch Thistle seeds germinate at any time of year but do so mainly in late summer-autumn and also late winter-spring, and start to form rosettes. A population may therefore consist of plants of many ages (sizes). Plants from late summer-autumn germination will flower and seed the following spring-summer and then die (i.e. they are annuals). Plants from winter or spring germination will also behave as annuals if they have enough chilling to allow stem elongation and flowerhead formation in the late spring. If chilling is insufficient then the rosette will persist over summer and the following winter then elongate, flower and seed then die during the second spring-summer (i.e. they are biennials) (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).\n\nMost Stemless Thistle seeds germinate in autumn after rain and during winter plants develop into small rosettes. The rosettes grow rapidly in spring with flowerheads forming by October-November and seed shedding by December followed by death of the plant. Sometimes late germinating seeds do not have a large enough rosette to flower by the summer and these rosettes over-winter with flowering, seeding and death occurring in the second spring-summer (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).\n\nIllyrian Thistle seeds germinate at any time of year but predominantly in autumn. It forms a rosette during winter with some plants elongating and flowering in the following spring, then seeding and dying or continuing to grow as a rosette through the summer, autumn and winter not flowering until the second spring-summer, then seeding and dying. There seems to be a chilling requirement before flowering can occur (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).",

The aquarium and garden plant industries have a major role to play in abiding by the relevant legislation. The sale or dumping of Lagarosiphon should be reported to the authorities and people who have unknowingly cultivated it should contact local councils or state or territory weed management agencies for information on how to dispose of it properly. Burial is the quickest means of disposal. Drying in the sun and/or burning are also suitable, providing there is no risk of accidental spread into a waterway (CRC 2003). Coughlan et al. (2020) found that exposure of the plants to steam for about 30 s following removal from the water was extremely effective in killing the plants.\n\nEarly detection and eradication are also important to prevent infestations of Lagarosiphon. Small infestations can be easily eradicated if they are detected early but an ongoing commitment is needed to stop new infestations. Any outbreaks should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Do not try to control Lagarosiphon without their expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nNo importation of Lagarosiphon into Australia is permitted because of the risk of further spread, and the potential introduction of male plants and extra genetic diversity that could make future control more difficult (CRC 2003).\n\nThe New Zealand experience has shown the difficulty of eradicating Lagarosiphon. Only a few very small infestations have been eradicated and it has continued to spread into new areas. In most cases control is ongoing because, unless all the Lagarosiphon is collected, it can grow back from any remaining fragments. (CRC 2003). Manual removal of Lagarosiphon by hand or mechanically is not effective, as it is impossible to collect all the vegetation, enabling re-infestation from remaining fragments.\n\nLagarosiphon has also been mechanically harvested from accessible areas, using a variety of methods such as hand cutting and suction dredging. However, it is virtually impossible to mechanically collect all vegetation, even from small areas, and infestations are able to regenerate from remaining fragments (CRC 2003).\n\nOther methods that have been used include covering the plant with black sheeting and lowering water levels to dry out the weed. Biological control is not currently an option (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: At present the only herbicide that is considered to be environmentally acceptable in New Zealand does not kill the rhizomes, so regrowth is inevitable. This herbicide can be applied by helicopter, providing cost-effective control at recreational sites, albeit on an ongoing basis.

    "controlMethods": "Madeira Vine is difficult to control with physical and chemical methods. Single chemical and /or physical control activities generally cause disturbance that results in vigorous regrowth and can worsen infestation levels, unless dedicated follow-up occurs.\n\nChemical control: Madeira Vine is hard to kill with chemicals due to its numerous tubers, succulent waxy leaves, and numerous roots. It has been recommended by some authors that all aerial bulbils are physically removed, and follow-up foliar spray is used on plants and bulbils as soon as green sprouts have two or four leaves on each sprout. Timing of follow-up spraying is important because if left too long, new underground tubers will form, prolonging control efforts. Some authors suggest that scraping stems at staggered intervals then applying a herbicide is the only recommended control method. Aerial stems should be cut at both ends and dipped in a herbicide (Invasive Species Specialist Group 2006). DPI NSW (2019) website list some herbicide options.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control of Madeira Vine is very difficult. All parts of the vine must be removed, including underground tubers (rhizomes), aerial tubers and vines climbing up trees to prevent them from resprouting. Smaller Madeira Vine plants can be grubbed out ensuring that all of the bulbils are removed. Larger infestations can be controlled by cutting back top growth and spraying the remaining 2 metres of stems (Invasive Species Specialist Group 2006). Carefully hand pulling and hanging up the root system away from the soil where the tubers and rhizomes cannot re-root is effective as it eventually causes death to the root system. Tubers / rhizomes can be killed by freezing, treating with foliar herbicides, or bagged and left in the sun (Land Protection 2006).  As mentioned above in the chemical treatment section, the physical removal of any surviving bulbils that have fallen on the ground after chemical or any other control methods is required to prevent the establishment of new plants. It is important to not plant or spread plants to new areas. bulbils, rhizomes and other fleshy parts of the plant could be double bagged and thrown away in the trash or piled in one location on site. Precaution could be taken to not spread green waste to uninfected areas (ISSG 2006).\n\nBiological control: DPI NSW (2019) state that the leaf feeding beetle, Plectonycha correntina has recently been approved for release in Australia. Both the adult and larval stages feed on the leaves reducing the plant’s photosynthetic ability and depleting the energy stores in the bulbils and tubers. Releases have occurred in New South Wales and Queensland—and at many of these sites the beetle has established and significant leaf feeding damage has been observed. The beetles lay small yellow eggs in groups of 8-15 on the undersides of leaves. After 5 days, larvae emerge and start feeding, covering themselves with a sticky, black, gelatine-like substance. After 14 days, they begin to feed alone, leaving their slimy covering behind, and emerging as small white, then butter-yellow grubs (3-4 mm long) with black heads. They then burrow into the topsoil to pupate for another 20 days, and then emerge as adult beetles, able to reproduce 7 days later. Each female can lay an average of 550 eggs. Beetles should only be used at sites that will not be subject to herbicide treatment or physical removal, and only in flood- and frost-free areas.\n\nIn Ku-ring-gai National Park, near Sydney, New South Wales, efforts have been made to annually apply herbicide by the stem-scrape method to kill vines in situ and to kill existing aerial tubers and prevent the development of more. Madeira Vine tubers were picked from the soil once native seedlings began to regenerate and removed to landfill. Regrowth was spot sprayed with herbicide where there were no native seedlings. Although floods bring more tubers from upstream sources into the reserve, this strategy has almost eliminated the production of tubers within the reserve and thus protects the regenerating areas and bushland downstream in Garigal National Park from this threat (Pallin 2000).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Flowering occurs during late summer and autumn but Madeira Vine rarely reproduces by seed. Growth rates of stems in warmer and moister regions can exceed 1 m per week and up to 6 m in a growing season (ISSG 2006).\n\nIn colder climates Madeira Vine growth rates can slow or stop completely in winter. Growth resumes in spring when temperatures increase. Leaf development is obvious on deciduous plants with fresh new green leaves produced. However, warmer micro-climates in the same area help some plants to continue to grow retaining their leaves, while nearby exposed plants are completely deciduous with no winter growth. Flowers are normally produced in summer.",

    "controlMethods": "Control is possible using chemical, mechanical and biological methods, and a combination (integrated management). Current research is investigating integration of traditional management practices (chemical and mechanical control) with fire, grazing management and biological control, which are more time- and cost-effective mechanisms. An integrated management strategy for Mesquite will vary with the infestation’s characteristics, including its size, age, density and habitat. In general, multi-stemmed mesquites are harder to control than single-stemmed trees (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: The basal bark and cut-stump techniques are effective on mature trees. Seedlings can be controlled by spraying foliar herbicide over the entire plant. This is particularly effective for dealing with actively growing, dense stands of Mesquite up to 1.5 m tall (CRC 2003). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical control techniques range from blade ploughing to grubbing and chaining. Mechanical control has varying levels of effectiveness depending on the size and species of the plant, but will kill Mesquite if the roots can be removed to a depth of 300 mm.\n\nFire can give good control of Mesquite, particularly Prosopis pallida. If necessary, mechanical control such as chaining can be used before burning to provide enough fuel to generate the heat required to kill Mesquite. Fire is relatively inexpensive and, even when it does not kill the entire plant, can reduce seed production by removing vegetation and killing seed lying on the ground surface. However, most of the other species of Mesquite are more resistant to fire, and resprout from the rootstock if the crown is removed by fire (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Mesquite has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.\n\nResearch for the biocontrol of mesquite (also called algaroba) (Prosopis L. spp. (Fabaceae)) in Australia commenced in early 1990s beginning with testing of two seed-feeding bruchids, from a biocontrol program initiated in South Africa (Harvey et al 2023).  Since this time, four species of insects have been released in Australia and include: the two seed-feeding bruchids (Algarobius bottimeri Kingsolver, Algarobius prosopis (Le Conte)) from North America, and a leaf-feeding psyllid (Prosopidopsylla flava Burckhardt) and leaf-tying moth (Evippe sp.) from Argentina (Harvey et al 2023).  Of these, only the seed feeding bruchid (A. prosopis) and the leaf-tying moth have established.  The leaf-tying moth is highly effective in suppressing the seed production and growth rate of mesquite, particularly in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.  Its presence in NSW however is rare and its impact is somewhat limiting in the Northern Territory and Queensland (Harvey et al 2023).  The seed feeding bruchid (A. prosopis) while widely established, exerts only limited population level regulation (van Klinken 2012; Winston et al. 2022).\n\nFor further information see the Mesquite Best Practice Manual (Osmond 2003) (available at https://www.weeds.org.au/WoNS/Mesquite/).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Mesquite has a long life cycle. In its native range plants live at least 30 years, but one specimen in the Brisbane Botanical Gardens is over 115 years old.\n\nBecause Mesquite is found over such a large area, and consists of several species and hybrids, there is much variation in its growth calendar. Its seeds can germinate year round as long as the soil is moist. The young seedlings are generally slow growing as resources are invested into establishing the root system. This can be extensive in mature trees, in some cases exceeding a depth of 50 m (CRC 2003). However, while plants generally flower and fruit for the first time between two and five years old, some have been observed to produce pods within their first year (Osmond 2003). Where winters are cold, Mesquite may shed its leaves in late autumn or early winter and undergo a dormant period until early spring (CRC 2003).\n\nFlowering in Mesquite occurs mainly in spring and early summer. The seed pods take two to three months to mature and generally drop in late summer. The seeds are dormant when dropped – the hard outer casing must be damaged to allow moisture into the seed before germination can occur. Animal consumption, fire or wet conditions are all ways of breaking the seed casing. If the seed casing is not broken, seeds lying in soil can remain viable for very long periods (CRC 2003).",

Continuous use of chemicals on plants can lead to herbicide resistance.\n\nNon-chemical control: Small outbreaks of Giant Sensitive Plant can be controlled by simple hand-pulling and grubbing. Note that because of seed-longevity – perhaps as much as 23 years in sandy soil but usually much shorter (Lonsdale et al. 1995) – it is necessary to revisit sites on a regular basis. Mechanical clearing of large infestations can occur after herbicide application. Chaining and chopper-rolling can also be used to clear large infestations.\n\nStrategic use of fire can also be effective. This is most effective if the plants are treated with herbicide first. If not 90% of mature plants and 50% of seedlings can regrow after fire (Australian Government 2009). Fire can be used to stimulate seed germination that is then sprayed with chemicals.\n\nBiological control: Long-term biological control offers the only cost-effective control of very large infestations. Since 1983 at least 13 insect and two fungal species have been released on Giant Sensitive Plant in Australia, with the most recent introduction – March 2007 – being a tiny beetle, Nesaecrepida infuscata, which attacks roots and leaves of the plant (Anon. 2007).\n\nFor more information on control methods, including details of biological control agents see, for example, Harley (1992), Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001), CRC for Weed Management (2003) and various papers in Julien et al. (2004).\n\nFor general information of the use of chemicals please visit the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority at http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "bestControlSeason": "Giant Sensitive Plant can germinate year round if the soil is moist but not flooded. However, most germination takes place at the start and end of the wet season. Growth in seedlings is rapid, and flowering occurs between 4 and 12 months after germination. The main flowering season is January-March but flowering can be extended into the dry season under moist conditions. Seeding occurs approximately five weeks after flowering and fruits ripen after about three months. Most seeds germinate when first wetted although a tough, impermeable coating allows some seeds to remain viable in sandy soil for over 20 years. Giant Sensitive Plant grows extremely quickly and in ideal conditions infestations double in size every 18 months (CRC 2003).",

    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Physical control: Hand hoeing or chipping is only economical for control of Noogoora Burr in small areas or sparsely populated situations. It is very labour intensive (NSW Agriculture 2004).\n\nGrazing of Noogoora Burr plants is an option, using sheep before flowering and after the cotyledon leaves have dried. A number of researchers and graziers have maintained that adult plants are not easily eaten by livestock, because of the roughness of the leaves and stems. Care needs to be taken with grazing to ensure there are no seedling plants, which could kill animals (NSW Agriculture 2004).\n\nChemical control: Both Noogoora and Californian burrs are susceptible to herbicides suited to a range of situations and regulations. Chemicals are most effective if the plants are young and actively growing. Plants under severe moisture or weather stress are difficult to kill (NSW Agriculture 2004). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nBiological control: A rust fungus, Puccinia xanthii, was first found in Australia near Brisbane in 1975 and then at Narrabri in 1978. Attack by P. xanthii has been shown to shorten the plant life cycle and reduce plant growth rate and productivity. Burr production was reduced by up to 59% but percentage seed germination remained unchanged.\n\nIn parts of New South Wales and Queensland, the rust can be effective in controlling both species, but timing and rate of spread depends on warm and humid conditions (NSW Agriculture 2004)\n\nNoogoora Burr has been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Since 1932 there have been four species introduced for controlling Noogoora Burr in Queensland, including Epiblema strenuana, a stem galling moth which was introduced into Australia in 1982 for the control of parthenium weed in Queensland and was found to be also affecting Noogoora Burr. In 1984 specific releases of the moth were made on Noogoora Burr in Queensland, where it has reduced the vigour of the plant.\n\nUnfortunately, these insects have had little or no effect in controlling Noogoora Burr within most of New South Wales because of the different variable climatic conditions of south-eastern Australia where Noogoora Burr is a problem (NSW Agriculture 2004).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Open Noogoora Burr plants produce 500 to 5 400 burrs per plant. The number of fruits produced is dependent upon the amount of vegetative growth at the time of floral initiation. On crowded plants, production is reduced to 71 to 586 burrs per plant (Weaver & Lechowicz 1983).\n\nGermination of Noogoora Burr seeds has been extensively researched (Crocker 1906; Davis 1930, Katoh & Esashi 1975, Zimmerman & Weis 1983). More than 80% of Noogoora Burr seeds are viable in most populations (Weaver & Lechowicz 1983). Light is not required for germination, but seedlings seldom emerge from seeds lying on the surface or buried more than 15 cm in the soil (Kaul 1965a; Stoller & Wax 1973).\n\nSeeds of Noogoora Burr have a high moisture requirement for germination (Kaul 1968). Noogoora Burr seed viability decreases over time, and seeds do not survive more than a few years (Wapshere 1974b).\n\nSeedlings are unusually large with foliar-type cotyledons that, through early photosynthetic function, enable the young seedling to become quickly established (Polunin 1966). Seedlings may be identified in the cotyledon stage by the presence (below ground) of the persistent bur, which usually remains attached to the seedling (Kingsbury 1964).\n\nNoogoora Burr plants produce seeds of two types. Each burr contains two seeds, with the smaller one often pushed upwards toward the beaked end of the fruit. The lower seed has a shorter dormant period and germinates first. Having at least two batches of seeds present in each generation is thought to assure germination in the event the immediate environment happens to be unsuitable (Redosevich & Holt 1984).\n\nGrowth is rapid in warm weather and burrs form from February to May. Plants die in late autumn but remain standing, bearing mature burrs for many months. Plants from seeds germinating late in summer produce burrs at a very early age when the plants are only a few centimetres high (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nThe species does not reproduce vegetatively (Weaver & Lechowicz 1983).",

Physical removal is difficult as the bulb-like underground stems (corms) may occur to a depth of 200 mm. Pulling on the leaf blades usually snaps them off at the top of the corm, leaving the corm in the soil. Cultivation is seldom useful as a control method and in fact may assist their dispersal by breaking up and distributing the corm. Limited success may be obtained where the corms can be brought to the soil surface to dry out in summer (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated).\n\nChemical control: Spot spraying is recommended, with a registered herbicide, just on flowering time when corm exhaustion occurs (Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nThese control methods are also likely to be effective on other Romulea species.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority at for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Seeds germinate in autumn to winter and flowering occurs in spring. (Hussey et al.1997; Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated).\n\nThe corms of weedy Romulea plants are summer-dormant in Western Australia, sending up their first shoots as the temperature drops with the autumn rains. Each year a new daughter corm (sometimes two), is formed as the plant is actively growing. Meanwhile the parent corm slowly exhausts and dies (Brown & Brooks 2002).",

    "controlMethods": "Ox-eye Daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare) can be hard to manage because it spreads so easily. Plants can be manages and controlled using herbicides and by physical and mechanical removal, cultivation and pasture management.  Using an integrated approach ( the use of different control options) will yield the best overall result. As plants produces many (each plant can produce up to 26,000 seeds) long-lived seeds, follow up will be critical. Return to control areas regularly to check progress and re-treat when needed.\n\nChemical control: A variety of chemical controls can be used in areas not suited to cultivation, but herbicides may damage non-target species (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).  Spraying large infestations is most effective when plants are in the early flowering stage. High rates of herbicide are needed to manage ox-eye daisy therefore early action to prevent large infestations establishing is best DPI NSW (2019). See DiTomaso &. Kyser et al. (2013). DPI NSW (2019) for some herbicide treatment that proved effective. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  Small population and outliers can be hand pulled or removed with hand tools. Remove roots from at least 10 cm below ground to avoid regrowth of the plant. This is easiest when the soil is damp and loose. Follow-up treatment will be required if seeds have been shed.\n\nMechanical control:  Because of its shallow root system, Ox-eye Daisy is easily killed by intensive cultivation. Deep cultivation (to 20 cm) can be effective, especially in summer. Additionally, shallower cultivation can kill seedlings and plants that have regrown from root fragments. Shallow cultivation on its own can spread the plant via root fragments. In pasture, mowing as soon as the first flowers open can prevent seed production. However, mowing may also stimulate shoot production and subsequent flowering in areas with adequate growing seasons (DPI NSW 2019).\nCompetition and management: Because seeds germinate readily on bare soil, keeping bare soil to a minimum is valuable in reducing seedling recruitment (Olson & Wallander 1999). Cultivation can be used as part of an integrated control program and followed up with the establishment of competitive plants like perennial pasture species. Repeat efforts and follow-up  will be needed to manage any seed stored in the soil.\nBiological control: one options for bio-control has been investigated by CSIRO, the rhizome-feeding moth Dichrorampha aearata  and an application to release it in Australia is currently being prepared. A second promising candidate bio-control agent for ox-eye daisy is under investigation, the root-feeding weevil Cyphocleonus trisulcatus. See CSIRO (2020) for details.",

    "controlMethods": "The economic costs of control are high once Parkinsonia becomes established. The prevention of spread within and between catchments, early detection and control of small manageable outbreaks are thus high priorities when considering management strategies (CRC 2003).\n\nSoil or sand which could contain Parkinsonia seeds should not be removed from infested areas. Any transport or machinery used in infested areas should be thoroughly cleaned before moving to other areas. Because water is responsible for much of the spread of Parkinsonia, outbreaks on watercourses, particularly in upper catchments, are a priority for control (CRC 2003).\n\nResearch into Parkinsonia control commenced in the 1950s and has been ongoing. The results from this research have shown that seedlings are particularly susceptible to different forms of control, especially fire, drought or inundation, soon after germination. An integrated approach using several weed management techniques (e.g. mechanical and chemical control, fire) is the most effective way to deal with dense infestations of Parkinsonia. However, the characteristics of the infestation (e.g. size, density, location, position within the catchment) and the availability of resources will determine the exact course that control should take.\n\nChemical control: There is a wide range of herbicides registered for Parkinsonia control, with several different application methods. Herbicides are useful for controlling dense high priority infestations but otherwise may be too expensive for widespread use. Particular care with herbicides should be taken near waterways (CRC 2003). Herbicides can be applied in a number of ways including aerial spraying and manual foliar application. Basal bark spraying and cut stump application can also be effective. For general information of the use of chemicals please visit the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority at http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical removal, such as hand pulling for small plants and bulldozing or chain pulling for larger plants, can be effective as long as roots are removed to a depth of 200 mm to prevent regrowth. Mechanical removal is more cost-effective that chemical control over large areas. However, it is not advised for river banks due to the potential for erosion and damage to non-target species. Follow-up is essential to treat seedlings (which can germinate prolifically in the disturbed ground) and any remaining adult plants (CRC 2003).\n\nFire kills seedlings and seeds on the surface and is an excellent form of follow-up control after mechanical or chemical control. With mature plants, however, the results are mixed. The Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines is currently researching which fire regimes give maximum kill rates of mature Parkinsonia in central Queensland (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Parkinsonia has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control has yet to show any major successes but research is continuing (CRC 2003).\n\nFor more detailed information on control strategies see Deveze (2004).\n\nFor further information see the Parkinsonia Best Practice Manual (available at https://www.weeds.org.au/WoNS/Parkinsonia)",

Spot and boom spraying are used to control the weed.  Herbicides, including rates of application, used for the control of Parthenium Weed are listed in web-based information sheets produced by the DPI NSW (2019); Queensland Government, Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (2020); and in Navie et al.

Warning: Hand-pulling of plants without using gloves and facial mask may result in allergic reactions.\n\nCompetition and management:  Pasture management the planting of vigorous pastures or crops provides competition to Parthenium Weed. The light grazing of pastures helps prevent invasion or re-establishment of Parthenium Weed.

It is recommended that the least affected areas of Prickly Acacia be controlled first to ensure the best value for money.\n\nChemical control: is most effective after the wet season when soil moisture is still high, and may be effected by basal bark spray (suitable for stems up to 100 mm in diameter, cut-stump technique or foliar (or overall), spraying (especially effective on seedlings and young plants up to 2 m tall as a follow-up to other forms of control)). Soil-applied herbicides placed as close to the trunk as possible can also be highly effective, especially when applied before rainfall (i.e. October-November for central Queensland).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical control should be conducted before the seed pods are dropped (the months before October to January), and will be particularly effective during drought because seedling regrowth is minimised. Large areas with a scattered to medium density of trees with trunk diameters less than 150 mm can be grubbed, cutting the root to at least 300 mm below the soil surface to prevent regeneration. Pushing and stickraking of Prickly Acacia are suited to large areas of medium-density infestation.\n\nChaining, or double-chain pulling, is especially useful for larger trees (greater than 40 mm trunk diameter) in established very dense stands of Prickly Acacia. Chaining is best suited to the second year of drought or before the first seed pod drop following drought. All forms of mechanical control will require follow-up to check for regrowth. Mechanical and chemical controls are both suitable as follow-ups.\n\nFire is effective against Prickly Acacia seedlings but mature trees are highly fire resistant.\n\nBiological control: Prickly Acacia has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Some native insect species that attack native acacias will also attack actively growing Prickly Acacia. One of these insects – the root eating Cicada Cicadema oldfieldi – is thought to be one of the causes of the Prickly Acacia dieback observed occasionally during drought conditions. A biological control program has been operating since 1980. Of 260 insect species known to attack Prickly Acacia, 17 are likely to only feed on Prickly Acacia and are therefore potentially suitable for introduction to Australia. So far, the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Water has released six insect species into Prickly Acacia infestations across the state. However, only a few of these species have established and their impacts have not been significant. Further research continues into the suitability and potential for success of other biocontrol species (CRC 2003).\n\nFor further information see the Prickly Acacia Best Practice Management Manual (available at https://www.weeds.org.au/WoNS/pricklyacacia).",

Trees can flower and fruit two to three years after germination, and more quickly after high rainfall years (CRC 2003). Below average rainfall following germination generally leads to very low establishment rates of seedlings (Mackey 1998).\n\nPrickly Acacia flowers between March and June, with pods forming between July and December.

Check with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for Rubber Vine control.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides are effective in the control of Rubber Vine, but their use is expensive when large areas are to be controlled. The strategic use of a range of registered herbicides is an effective method of controlling isolated or outlying Rubber Vine plants. Foliar spraying the entire plant from the ground and aerial spraying are most effective on smaller plants. The basal bark and cut stump techniques are more labour intensive, but are much more effective on more mature plants. All of these techniques should only be conducted when Rubber Vine is actively growing and are also less effective if plants have been damaged by biological control agents (CRC 2003; Land Protection 2006).\n\nNon-chemical control: Fire can be an especially valuable and inexpensive part of an integrated Rubber Vine control program because it kills surface seeds, seedlings and adult plants. If there is sufficient fuel, Rubber Vine can be burnt whilst green with good success. In a fire research experiment west of Chillagoe in Queensland, 80% of the Rubber Vine was killed in an initial fire, with a follow-up burn one year later resulting in a 99% kill rate. The fuel load should be about 1500 kg per hectare and pasture may need to be spelled before burning to allow the fuel to accumulate to high enough levels (CRC 2003).\n\nBlade or disc ploughs and cutter bars provide reasonable control of Rubber Vine, but are most often used to penetrate very dense infestations to allow easier access, or to open up the canopy. Mechanical control is not suited to areas such as gullies and creeks because it can lead to erosion. Recent research has shown that the use of fire after biological control agents have already damaged the plants can be highly effective. However, control programs should be tailored to the location, size, intensity and age of each situation (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Two biological control agents have become widespread in Queensland, since their release in the early 1990s and they have had an impact on the vigour of Rubber Vine. Rubber Vine Rust (Maravalia cryptostegiae) forms on the underside of leaves and causes them to turn yellow and drop and rust is usually abundant during the wet season but is less active during the dry season. The other agent is the Rubber Vine Moth (Euclasta whalleyi), whose caterpillars feed on Rubber Vine leaves between March and October. Both agents, especially the rust, can cause significant damage, but their effectiveness varies according to climatic conditions (CRC 2003; Land Protection 2006).\n\nAlso see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nFor further information see the Rubber Vine Management Manual (available at https://www.weeds.org.au/WoNS/rubbervine/ )",

The recommended control for Saffron Thistle is a rotation of a 2-3 years cropping phase followed by pasture.\n\nChemical control: There are various herbicides available for effective chemical treatments. Control is often difficult because there are a range of plants at different growth stages. Spot spray for smaller patches and boom spray for larger areas. Seedlings which emerge in the crop can be controlled with herbicide (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). For information on herbicide treatments please see: DPIPWE Tasmania (2019); DPI NSW (2019); HerbiGuide (2021); Parsons & Cuthbertson( 2001); Tamar Valley Weed Strategy (2015).  Please check the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Single plants or small populations can be removed by hand or chipping out if recently new to an area.  However, not normally practical as this species seems to occurs in larger numbers than one or few individuals.\n\nMechanical control:  The seeds of Saffron Thistle rarely germinate from below 5 cm in the soil. Deep ploughing to bury seeds below 10 to 15 cm is a good starting point for control. Any seedlings that emerge after that can be destroyed by shallow cultivation and the area then planted to cereal crop under sown by pasture species. Mowing, cutting or slashing also effectively prevents seed production if carried out just before flowering. However, plants can regrow from buds near their base if this is carried out too early (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\nCompetition and management: A persistent approach combining cropping and pasture establishment is an effective method of control.

    "controlMethods": "Successful management is achieved when control methods are combined (an integrated control method) in order to put greater pressure on the weed, or to treat the weed.\n\nChemical control: Salvinia can be sprayed with various herbicides including Diqaut, glyphosate, and Carfentrazone-ethyl. Results can be variable as upper leaf surfaces are largely non-wettable making absorption of herbicides difficult (Muyt 2001). There are no situations where a single application of herbicide will provide ongoing control of Salvinia. Initial treatments will always need to be followed up with further treatments. The correct application and timing is important and may vary across Australia.\n\nWarning: Herbicide use in and around water may require a licence and each State and Territory has regulations for the use of herbicides in and near waterways. Please check with your relevant government department and always check the product label information for safety information to people and wildlife and for irrigation water withholding periods. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Manual (hand) removal plant can be removed by hand from small ponds but every plant needs to be removed as vegetative growth will occur plants will multiply eventually covering the pond. Large infestations are sometimes gathered with mechanical harvesters and scoops, although the effectiveness of this method is limited by the ease with which the plants break into fragments (Muyt 2001).\n\nBooms and containment fences: Containing infestations with booms or meshed containment fences should be used to prevent further spread and keep intake or other areas free of Salvinia. Containment is important for infestations, where an infestation has the ability to spread and invade new areas;  keeping certain areas Salvinia free; contain sections of Salvinia in one area to minimise costs and the time required to carry out herbicide treatments or physical removal; separate areas for different control treatments (i.e. different herbicides, herbicide and biological control, mechanical removal, and biological control. it is important to Identify the source of the infestation  to avoid further spread and re-infestation.\n\nManagement: Salvinia grows faster and produces more growth the higher the nutrient levels in a water body. Reducing  the growth and biomass of Salvina involves reducing nutrient levels in waterways. This can be achieved by  managing erosion on cultivated land, controlling stock access to banks, diverting effluent before it enters the waterway, and not washing waste from cattle yards or dairies into waterways (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nDisposal: Small infestations in home ponds and aquaria can be gathered with fine-woven scoops, placed in sealed plastic bags and destroyed by leaving the bags in a warm, sunny place for a few days (Muyt 2001). Plants deposited on the banks of water-bodies can be moved away from the water’s edge, and preferably burnt, to prevent reintroduction (Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Water 2006).\n\nBiological control: Salvinia has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. The Salvinia Weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) has undergone CSIRO research and has been released in Australia as a biological control agent. Although effective in tropical areas it has little impact in more temperate climates (Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Water 2006). The Salvinia weevil is a small, black insect which grows to about 2 mm long. Adult weevils feed on the growing tips, suppressing growth. Larvae tunnel through the horizontal stems, particularly in younger parts of the plant causing the weed to break apart, sink and decompose on the bottom of the waterway.  The Salvinia weevil does most damage when Salvinia is healthy and green and the temperature is around 30°C. Weevils breed very slowly at temperatures less than 20 °C and ceases breeding below about 17 °C.  The best time to introduce the weevil is early spring as the warmer weather helps populations establish (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nFor further information on all control methods see the Salvinia Control Manual (Oosterhout 2006) and the NSW Weedwise website (DPI NSW 2019).",

Growth is limited or absent under 10°C with plants can survive being frozen and salinities up to one tenth of sea water (CRC 2003). Salvinia can regenerate after being drought stressed, heat stressed or frosted, with new green leaves appearing on a dead-looking brown weed mat. Frost kills exposed leaves and buds, but leaves and buds within the weed mat can survive provided that they do not freeze. Buds will also remain viable in dry or extremely hot conditions if they are protected inside the weed mat (Oosterhout 2006).",

New weeds should be removed before they become established (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can be used successfully in controlling Sand Rocket. However the biology of the species coupled with the complexities of modern cropping and weed management require careful and well researched decisions to be made to maximise effectiveness and to limit off target impacts (Mathison 2000). Populations of Sand Rocket resistant to Group B/2 herbicides have been discovered in cereal crops in South Australia (Preston 2005).

    "controlMethods": "Control of Onopordum spp. is difficult and therefore time consuming and expensive. The best defence against invasion of Onopordum spp. on agricultural lands is maintaining healthy perennial pasture with good ground cover at all times to prevent seedling establishment. for dense infestations an integrated management program using of a range of tools such as the maintenance of a strong perennial pasture, strategic herbicide application, chipping by hand and use of biological control agents where appropriate is the best strategy for long term control. The key to managing thistles is reduce or prevent plants setting viable seed, and in doing so the following year’s population will be greatly reduced (DPI NSW 2019)\n\nChemical control: Herbicide control of these three Onopordum species can be very effective and is an essential part of the overall management of these thistles and are used on large or dense infestations applying . However, plants can be tricky  to kill  because of the difficulty in wetting the woolly-hairy leaves of the plants. To achieve an effective kill the following should be considered; Timing of application is also important. If a single application of herbicide is undertaken then a springtime application is best (Dellow 1996), as herbicides are most effective on seedlings and young rosettes, Once plants begins stem elongation, herbicides may be less effective; The hairy leaves of the thistles can reduce herbicide effectiveness through reduced absorption. Therefore it is important to follow the herbicide label and use the recommended rate, application volume and adjuvant; Control will be reduced if plants are stressed. When there is a low density of thistles spot spraying  is preferred (DPI NSW 2019). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information available at http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  When there is a low density of thistles hand chipping is effective. Remove as much of the taproot as possible so that regrowth does not occur. Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Slashing or mowing is not usually effective as plants develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Plants can be mown or slashed before flowering to prevent seed set but this is temporary as plants will regrow and develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed and spread seed.\n\nCompetition and management: Pasture management is the most important part of any thistle control program and maintaining a dense, vigorous and competitive, and vigorous perennial grass pasture provides competition for germinating thistles, reducing seedling establishment. Gaps in the pasture result in an increase in thistle germination and seedling survival so maintaining excellent ground cover at all times is desirable (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nWhile thistles respond to increases in soil fertility (and in particular nitrogen), management of all pasture types should aim to maintain pastures that have a good balance of perennial grass to legume content. Fertiliser application (as determined by a soil test) will improve the vigour of annual and perennial introduced grasses, increasing ground cover and reducing future thistle establishment.\n\nThistles are generally avoided by stock. However goats eat thistles at both the rosette and flowering stage as well as post-flowering. Horses, and sometimes cattle graze the flower which can reduce the amount of seed. The amount eaten depends on the grazing pressure and the amount of other feed available (DPI NSW 2019).  With existing infestations of Illyrian Thistle goats are known to be effective in grazing the rosettes, and also the flower-heads once the plant has elongated. This can be a vital step as it reduces seed production and thus limits recruitment of new thistle plants and also reduces the build up of seed in the soil. The soil seedbank is relatively long-lived (Holst & Allan 1996).\n\nBiological control: Onopordum spp. has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control of all three Onopordum thistles discussed here is under study with three insects released into infestations – a seed head weevil, a stem boring weevil and a crown moth the larvae of which attacks leafstalks, the crown of the rosette and also the roots (Dellow & Holtkamp 2005). The following summary is taken from DPI NSW (2019)\n\nSeed-head weevil. The seed-head weevil, Larinus latus, was released in spring 1992. A single larva is capable of destroying all the seed in a flower head of 3 cm diameter or less and more than one larva may develop in larger heads. This weevil has only one generation per year so it has taken a number of years for populations to grow large enough to destroy most of the seed in a flower head. This insect has reduced seed production by more than 80 per cent.\n\nStem-boring weevil. The stem-boring weevil, Lixus cardui, was first released in November 1993 and is now widely established. The stem-boring weevil is not capable of killing Onopordum thistles. Its activity weakens the plant, makes it less competitive and reduces seed production. This action allows insects such as the seed head weevil to have a greater impact on the plant.\n\nCrown moth. The crown moth, Eublemma amoena, was first released in 1998. There are three adult generations per year, commencing in spring when adults emerge from pupal cells in thistle rosettes. Females lay eggs on leaves and larvae feed in the leaf petioles, causing leaves to shrivel and die. Larvae can also bore into the crown and root of the plant. This may lead to the death of smaller plants. Larvae of subsequent generations feed in the leaves of stems, causing similar leaf shriveling, reducing plant vigour.\n\nRosette weevil. The rosette weevil, Trichosirocalus briesei, was first released in 1997. It is now established in many areas and is starting to have an impact on thistle populations. Adults are 3–5 mm long and a mottled brown colour. There is one generation per year. Adults emerge from a summer dormancy period following autumn rains and commence feeding on rosette leaves. Females lay eggs near the base of the rosette leaves. After hatching, larvae destroy the growing point of the rosette either killing the plant or severely reducing its vigour.\n\nFor further information on the control of Onopordum spp. see Keith Turnbull Research Institute (1998), DPI NSW (2008); DPI NSW 2019; DPIW (2002), and the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia (undated);",
    "bestControlSeason": "Scotch Thistle seeds germinate at any time of year but do so mainly in late summer-autumn and also late winter-spring, and start to form rosettes. A population may therefore consist of plants of many ages (sizes). Plants from late summer-autumn germination will flower and seed the following spring-summer and then die (i.e. they are annuals). Plants from winter or spring germination will also behave as annuals if they have enough chilling to allow stem elongation and flowerhead formation in the late spring. If chilling is insufficient then the rosette will persist over summer and the following winter then elongate, flower and seed then die during the second spring-summer (i.e. they are biennials) (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).\n\nMost Stemless Thistle seeds germinate in autumn after rain and during winter plants develop into small rosettes. The rosettes grow rapidly in spring with flowerheads forming by October-November and seed shedding by December followed by death of the plant. Sometimes late germinating seeds do not have a large enough rosette to flower by the summer and these rosettes over-winter with flowering, seeding and death occurring in the second spring-summer (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).\n\nIllyrian Thistle seeds germinate at any time of year but predominantly in autumn. It forms a rosette during winter with some plants elongating and flowering in the following spring, then seeding and dying or continuing to grow as a rosette through the summer, autumn and winter not flowering until the second spring-summer, then seeding and dying. There seems to be a chilling requirement before flowering can occur (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).",

However, Serrated Tussock is known to have herbicide resistance in some locations in Australia. Herbicide resistance is the ability of a plant to survive and reproduce following application of a herbicide. In addition, herbicide treatment alone that kills target plants will not give long-term control. Spot spraying with a registered herbicide is only effective to control light and scattered infestations with follow-up required.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Only very young plant can be removed by hand-pulling. The extensive root system on mature to adult plants prevents hand-pulling . However, Chipping mature plants out the ground with a mattock before tussocks set seed can kill most plants. However, for large plants where moist soil is present around the remaining roots in the ground, follow-up treatment is required as plant can re-grow from these roots.\n\nCompetition and management: On arable land, Serrated Tussock can be successfully controlled with a program of ploughing, cropping and pasture improvement. Invasion from wind-blown seeds can be reduced by planting windbreaks. Sowing perennial pastures such as Phalaris and improved pastures in general should be established to compete with Serrated Tussock and prevent re-invasion. Stock grazed on Serrated Tussock producing mature seed should be placed in a holding paddock for 10 days before moving them into a clean paddock (CRC 2003) as seeds can remain viable in the stomach of animals for up to 10 days.\n\nMulching, the application of material over the ground such as straw, wood chips, carpet or plastic sheeting will prevent the growth of all plants, including Serrated Tussock and beneficial plants. Suitable for small infestation in native or urban areas, and large infections in agricultural situations.\n\nFire can be used to reduce bio-mass and kill seeds on the plant and soil surface, but will not kill adult plants or buried seed. Fire stimulates re-growth and mass germination of seed so vigorous and planned follow-up is required to control plants.\n\nBiological control: Although Serrated Tussock has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process, there are currently no effective useful biological control agents. Three biological control agents against Serrated Tussock have been investigated for release into Australia: a rust, Puccinia nassellae, a smut, Ustilago spp., and another fungus. A fungus that occurs naturally on native Austrostipa spp. has also been observed to attack Serrated Tussock in the field (CRC 2003), but none of the three agents proved to be a successful candidate for further testing as biological Control agents.\n\nFor further information and detailed methodology of control is outlined in (Osmond et al. 2008) and in various publication on the ‘Victorian Serrated Tussock Working Party’ (2020) web page (http://www.serratedtussock.com/management/fact-sheets)",
    "bestControlSeason": "Serrated Tussock is a perennial grass that reproduces from seed. It builds large seed banks in the soil and, although most seed die within three years, some may stay viable for decades.\n\nSeeds germinate at any time of year but mostly in autumn and winter. Seedlings grow slowly and need to establish before summer as competition for moisture and light can lead to stress and death.  Plants rarely flower in the first year of growth; flowers and seeds are usually produced in the second summer. Flower stalks usually appear in spring, but in dry years the plants flower earlier. By the time it flowers, Serrated Tussock leaves are long and drooping. The seed ripen with 10 weeks of flowers being produced and seeds remain attached to the stem that breaks-off at the base and is blown away aiding dispersal. The plant mainly grows during spring and early summer, and is bleached by frosts to golden yellow tussocks in autumn and winter (CRC 2003).",

    "origin": "For many years it had been unclear whether Silver-leaf Nightshade originated in North America or South America but recent DNA studies have shown its relationships lie with other Mexican and southern USA species of Solanum and so this is likely to be its area of origin, with  and recent studies confirming that Silver-leaf Nightshade is probably native to the Monterrey region of north-eastern Mexico (Heap & Wu 2018). Early American colonists were presumably responsible for its spread outside this region into other areas of the Americas (Levin et al. 2006).  It is now a weed in may areas outside it native range.",
    "controlMethods": "Silver-leaf Nightshade is extremely difficult to control and so the best prevention is early eradication of plants as soon as they are recognised. Animals should not be allowed to eat fruiting plants, not only because the fruits can be poisonous, but also because it can increase seed dispersal. Vehicles and machinery need to be thoroughly cleaned. Recent studies (Hawker et al. 2006) have shown that there is a great deal of genetic diversity within the South Australian populations and that seeds seem to play the major role in spreading this plant. There are three major goals when managing dense, established infestations: 1) Prevent seed production. 2) Kill shoots during summer/ autumn to protect following crop and pasture yield. 3) Reduce the size and vigour of the root system over time (Heap & Wu 2018).\n\nChemical control: Silver-leaf Nightshade can be difficult to control with herbicides because of the horizontal root system from which new plants are able to establish. Glyphosate and picloram have been found to be effective in other countries. For effective control with chemicals foliar application is required with numerous applications need over 3-5  years to exhaust the root system. For a list of herbicides and methods for use in Australia see Heap and Wu (2018); Smith & Faithfull (1998) . Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Manual (hand) removal or Mechanical (machine removal) is not recommended as roots are deep (up to metres deep) and need to be removed as new plants can grow from the smallest root fragment. Mechanical control that disturbed the roots will only spread roots and stimulate growth of new plants.\n\nCultivation: The ability of Silver-leaf Nightshade plants to re-sprout has meant that mowing or cultivation of the ground is not an option as this disturbed and spreads root fragments which are also capable of producing new plants.\n\nVigorous crops and pastures, especially those based on perennial summer-growing species can significantly suppress Silverleaf Nightshade growth (Heap and Wu 2018). Shading provided a crop canopy could be used a control mechanism in small patches, provided a crop canopy could be established before the plant matures (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007). Given that Silver-leaf Nightshade generally has a competitive advantage this can be difficult to achieve and this method is not likely to be useful in Australia’s broad-acre farming areas, although a crop of Lucerne may be useful in this regard (Smith & Faithfull 1998).\n\nGrazing: by sheep and goats could “reduce the size and number of Silver-leaf Nightshade shoots during the growing season, as well as suppressing flowering and seed set” (Hawker 2004). However, cattle and sheep should not be allowed to eat fruiting plants, not only because the fruits can be poisonous, but also because it can increase seed dispersal. Establishment of new Silver-leaf Nightshade infestations on clean land overwhelmingly originate from seeds ingested by livestock that have eaten ripe fruits. Animals  should be quarantined in a holding zone /paddock in for 7 days before being transport to other areas free of Silver-leaf Nightshade to help reduce risk of spread. The vast majority of seeds pass through animals with 7 days but some may still are excreted  2-3 weeks after ingestion.\n\nDisposal: Any roots that are dug up should be disposed of as root fragments can produce new plants if left in or on the soil.\n\nBiological control: Silver-leaf Nightshade has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. A leaf galling nematode was tested as a biological control agent in Victoria in the 1980s but because it was found to affect other Solanum species grown as crops it was not able to be released. Other biological control agents have been tested but were also found to impact closely related crop plants. No biological agent is available in Australia.",
    "bestControlSeason": "Silver-leaf Nightshade is a summer-growing perennial plant, with an extensive root system. Seeds germinate in autumn and there is a concentration on root growth initially. Roots can grow very deep (up to 2 metres) and extend horizontally d 1 to 2 metres per year via creeping horizontal lateral roots to produce new shoots at a distance the parent plant.  New shoots emerge from the horizontal roots in spring and plants begin flowering by November, continuing into summer. Fruits are produced in the summer months. Above ground parts of the plant die back at the end of summer but the dried plants with their attached fruits are persistent for some time (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "origin": "Skeleton Weed originated in Eurasia and its native range extends from western Europe, the Mediterranean region and north Africa to central Asia. It is now found in central Europe, North and South America, Australia and New Zealand (McVean 1966; Panetta & Dodd 1995; Holm et al. 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "Skeleton Weed (Chondrilla juncea), once established, can be difficult to eradicate. Cultivation of infested areas should be avoided, especially in cultivated crops, due to the regenerating properties of cut underground stems as the chopped roots have the ability to re-shoot and establish new plants. It is also important to prevent plants from seeding. Preventing further spread using quarantine and restriction on the sale and movement of produce and machinery from affected areas will reduce the risk of spread. Farm equipment, vehicles and other objects should be checked and cleaned to prevent the movement of seed or root pieces to uninfested areas. Control is assisted through regular surveillance and public awareness, especially amongst farming communities. Infested and treated areas require regular monitoring (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Fletcher et al. 2003; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2006, 2007a, undated).\n\nChemical control:  The deep and extensive roots of Skeleton Weed make it difficult to control with chemical herbicides and successful control can only be achieved with multiple applications.  Chemical management, using herbicides often in conjunction with cropping is a valuable control tool (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2005b, 2006, 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, 2007d). Please see DPIRD (2021) and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  Small infestations of Skeleton Weed can be controlled by hand pulling when the soil is wet. This must be done several times per year for several years but the deep root system may resprout. Plant roots can grow to 1 metre in a single season eventually reach 2-3 meters deep.\n\nMechanical control: It is also important to prevent plants from seeding. This can be done by mowing pastures before the seeds are formed. Cultivation is not recommended as this breaks up and spreads root fragments that re-sprout and develop in to new plants.\nCompetition and management: Grazing also helps prevent or reduce seed production (e.g. continuous grazing by sheep can keep plants in the rosette stage during summer). In some areas it is useful to introduce vigorous competitive crops, such as the legumes Lucerne, Subterranean Clover and Barrel Medic, to help suppress the seedlings. Establishing a strong pasture with species that can shade out Skeleton Weed seedlings and successfully compete for soil moisture and nutrients can help control this weed (Cunningham et al. 1992; Felfoldi 1993; Panetta & Dodd 1995; Holm et al. 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Weed management has been assisted by changing from the agricultural practice of continuous cropping (which exhausts the soil and can promote the spread of Skeleton Weed) to mixed farming involving legume establishment and animal grazing (which increases soil fertility and provides a more stable farming system) (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\nBiological control: A parasitic rust fungus (Puccina chondrillia) was introduced to Australia in 1971 to control the species (Cooke 1986) together with two other control agents, a gall mite (Aceria chondrillae) and a gall midge (Cystophora schmidt).  Results were positive with initially control reducing infestations dramatically. In 1973, Hull and Groves (1973), after very careful field observations, published a paper in the Australian Journal of Botany in which they reported three forms, or biotypes, of skeleton weed in the eastern States which they labelled 'Form A, narrow leaved', 'Form C. broad leaved' and an 'intermediate, Form B'. It soon became apparent that two of the released agents, the Puccini a rust and the Aceria mite were careful to choose only the narrow leaved biotype as the host. The midge, the third agent, was capable of attacking all three forms. An integrated control program is still required using all forms of control, including competition from fertility building pastures, spot spraying and the use of selective herbicides in crops.",
    "bestControlSeason": "Seeds germinate after autumn rains and the young plants form rosettes with a developing taproot during winter. In spring, about September, an erect stem is produced from the rosette centre. As the plant grows, the rosette leaves die leaving a virtually leafless much-branched wiry plant that flowers from late spring but mainly through summer and autumn. Seeds are also produced throughout summer and autumn. In autumn, the aerial growth dies and is easily broken off at ground level. One to three new rosettes develop from each rootstock (taproot) in autumn to early winter and these produce flowering stems and flowers in the following spring to summer. New rosettes are also formed on lateral roots, thus increasing spread of the plant. Cultivation at almost any time of the year will stimulate production of new rosettes from the taproot and severed root fragments. Under drought conditions, which limit aerial growth, new rosettes may be produced whenever effective rain is received (Felfoldi 1993; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "origin": "Soursob originated in South Africa and, with several other species of Oxalis, was taken to Europe in the 18th century for promotion as an ornamental plant. It soon became established as a weed in southern Europe where it is common in orchards, vineyards and cereal crops, particularly in Italy, Greece, Malta and Portugal. From Europe it has spread all over the world including Australia and it is also a troublesome weed in other including North and South America, New Zealand, Morocco, India, Israel, Lebanon, Tunisia and even in its native South Africa (where it is proclaimed a noxious weed) (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "Soursob (Oxalis pes-caprae) is difficult to eradicate unless control methods are well timed and persistent over several years. The plant must be attacked at a critical stage in its life cycle called the bulb exhaustion stage. This is when the food material of the  bulb is exhausted and any new bulbils are not sufficiently developed to survive. Unfortunately this stage cannot be accurately determined by looking at the aerial growth, only by digging up plants and inspecting the bulbs. The bulb exhaustion stage is just at, or just prior, to flowering. Unfortunately, not all plants in an infestation will be at the same stage at the same time. Any control method, be it cultivation or chemical, should be aimed at this critical stage (Muyt 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nChemical control: Chemical control of Soursob is often the most practical option available for dense infestations in bushland and in cropping areas. It is practical on both a large and small scale, avoids soil disturbance and prevents soil erosion (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nFoliar sprays:  Spot spray is the method of application. Apply at bulb exhaustion stage, generally just on flowering. Read the manufacturers' labels and material safety data sheets before using herbicides.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au . NOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most states and territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Occasional Soursob plants may be carefully dug out, but hand removal after bulbil formation will dislodge bulbils and contribute to their spread (Muyt 2001; Brown & Brooks 2002). Exercise care if manually removing as physical removal can result in further spread of bulbils. Repeated pulling of the tops will deplete the bulb’s carbohydrate reserves, but these efforts take years to be successful.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation can provide control on new infestations. Repeated tillage is required to effectively control the bulbs.\n\nCultural: Grazing is not considered an effective control option. Plants contain variable quantities of soluble oxalates and can be lethally toxic to livestock when ingested in quantity.\n\nFire: Burning is also not considered to be an effective control option.",
    "bestControlSeason": "Soursob bulbs sprout in autumn before or after soaking rains. The bulb first produces a slender stem or rhizome which thickens as it reaches the soil surface. Aerial growth commences as a rosette of leaves, the leaf stems becoming erect during early winter, at which time flowering stems are also produced. Flowering occurs from June to October after which rising temperatures kill the aerial growth (Blood 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nDuring early growth, one of the roots at the base of the bulb swells to form a translucent, brittle, contractile tuber several centimetres long. A new bulb is formed at the top of this tuber and, in developing, draws on moisture and minerals from the tuber which eventually shrivels and contracts, drawing the new bulb deeper into the soil (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). During the growing season it is common for two bulbs to develop inside the old bulb and one on the tuber. Many bulbils, often more than 20, develop on the rhizomatous stem above the bulb (Brooks 2001).",

    "controlMethods": "Spear Thistle (Cirsium vulgare) is mainly controlled by herbicide application and can be managed by cultivation. Not eaten by cattle or sheep, but eaten by goats. In pastures, the most effective form of control is maintenance of a healthy perennial pasture at all seasons, but particularly in summer going into autumn when the weed mostly germinates.\n\nChemical control: Spear Thistles at the seedling stage are susceptible to growth regulator type herbicides. When practicable, spraying should be completed before the centre flowering stem develops. Although Spear Thistle remains reasonably susceptible even up to flowering, treatment at this late stage involves the use of more active forms of the herbicides and of higher application rates, with a consequent risk of greater pasture legume damage (DPIW 2002).\n\nIn years when there is an early autumn break and large numbers of thistles germinate before the temperature falls, autumn spraying can be very effective. Spraying at this time also requires lower herbicide rates, is less damaging to clover and allows the desirable pasture species to grow with reduced competition from the thistles (DPIW 2002).\n\nIn most winters when the temperature falls to near freezing, Spear Thistles become dormant and very much less susceptible to herbicides. Susceptibility increases again with the onset of spring growth and spraying can usually be resumed effectively in September or October (DPIW 2002).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Single or small population can be chipped out by hand, removing most of the roots.\n\nMechanical control: For existing infestations cultivation of the infested area while plants are rosettes is effective provided follow-up cultivation of new seedlings and any regrowth occurs. Re-sowing of perennial pasture will reduce the chance of re-infestation. Management of grazing during autumn to reduce grazing pressure will also assist the pasture to remain vigorous (DPIW 2002).\nCompetition and management: The best means of control of Spear Thistle is to establish a well maintained perennial pasture. This will reduce the likelihood of new infestations establishing (DPIW 2002). For existing infestations cultivation of the infested area while plants are rosettes is effective provided follow-up cultivation of new seedlings and any regrowth occurs. Re-sowing of perennial pasture will reduce the chance of re-infestation. Management of grazing during autumn to reduce grazing pressure will also assist the pasture to remain vigorous (DPIW 2002).\nWhile Spear Thistles are not normally grazed by cattle or sheep, goats will graze Spear Thistles at the flowering stage, eating flowers, seed heads and stems. Over a period of several seasons this prevention of seed production can produce a significant reduction in Thistle numbers (DPIW 2002).\nBiological control: Spear Thistle has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. A research program into possible biological control agents has been undertaken in Victoria, focused on the Spear Thistle Gall Fly (Urophora stylata) and a thistle receptacle Weevil (Rhinocyllusconicus). It is hoped these will reduce seed production in the field (Keith Turnbull Institute 1998).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Spear Thistle behaves as an annual or biennial. Seeds may germinate at any time of the year but do so predominantly in autumn after rain with a second germination peak in late winter/early spring. After germination and establishment the plant forms a rosette and then, after experiencing a cold lengthy period, will elongate to form an erect flowering stem which sets seed and dies. Because of its ability to germinate whenever moisture is available and warmth is adequate infestations of Spear Thistle will usually have plants showing a range of growth stages (Bruzzese 1996).\n\nSeed production is very high but a high proportion of that seed germinates in the year following production (Bruzzese 1996).\n\nPlants germinating in autumn will elongate in spring, flower in summer then set seed and die. They are winter annuals with a 6–9 month life cycle (Bruzzese 1996).\n\nPlants that germinate in late winter/early spring will form a rosette that grows over summer, autumn and winter, then flower the next summer, set seed and die. These are biennials with a 12–15 month life cycle (Bruzzese 1996).\n\nRarely plants germinating in summer and forming a rosette may flower in the autumn presumably after experiencing a cold snap. These are summer annuals (Bruzzese 1996).",

For large areas infested with Spiny Emex, shallow cultivate in late summer to encourage germination in autumn and then kill the seedlings with cultivation or herbicides. Deep ploughing is not recommended because it buries seed and induces dormancy, which may be broken when the seeds are returned to the surface in following seasons. Any control program must aim at killing all plants shortly after emergence, and needs to be continued for several years (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). 'Prickle rollers' have been developed to gather and remove surface Spiny Emex fruit from drying greens in vineyards (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: Cultivation kills seedlings, and can be effective when combined with chemical control (Gilbey et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Land Protection 2006).

See DPI NSW (2019) & Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001) for further herbicide information. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Isolated plants should be grubbed out, ensuring that the bulk of the taproot is removed. If near the seeding stage, these plants should be heaped and burnt to destroy seeds.\n\nCompetition and management:  For larger infestations, cultivation is effective particularly in the early growth stages. Once the plants reach the rosette stage, cultivation must be at least 10 cm deep to sever the taproot at a depth from which regrowth does not occur. Cultivation can be combined with growing a fodder crop or establishing a pasture which should be adequately top dressed and only lightly grazed in order to provide maximum competition to seedlings (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In the pasture phase, it is important to maintain a competitive pasture. Treat any new emergence of thistles with either physical measures or herbicide. In cropping situations, cultivation can stimulate the germination of seeds. Using cultivation combined with herbicides can give positive results as long as thistles are treated at the seedling or rosette stage of growth, usually during winter and early spring.\nMechanical control:  Slashing is effective if carried out just before flowering. Mowing is equally effective but, if left until early flowering, there may be enough food material in the cut stems to allow the seeds to mature. Slashing on the other hand, has the advantage of destroying many of the seed heads. If either slashing or mowing is carried out too early, the plants may regrow from buds at the base and produce new flowering stems.",
    "bestControlSeason": "Seeds will germinate at any time of the year if moisture is available, however most germination occurs after autumn. Rosettes are formed during winter and spring, and in most cases flowering stems are produced in late spring. In some cases, however, plants do not produce flowering stems until the second spring, thus becoming biennials. In either case, flowering commences about November and continues until February or even later, after which the plants die. The seed is relatively short lived, surviving in the soil for only two to three years (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "controlMethods": "Control of Onopordum spp. is difficult and therefore time consuming and expensive. The best defence against invasion of Onopordum spp. on agricultural lands is maintaining healthy perennial pasture with good ground cover at all times to prevent seedling establishment. for dense infestations an integrated management program using of a range of tools such as the maintenance of a strong perennial pasture, strategic herbicide application, chipping by hand and use of biological control agents where appropriate is the best strategy for long term control. The key to managing thistles is reduce or prevent plants setting viable seed, and in doing so the following year’s population will be greatly reduced (DPI NSW 2019)\n\nChemical control: Herbicide control of these three Onopordum species can be very effective and is an essential part of the overall management of these thistles and are used on large or dense infestations applying . However, plants can be tricky  to kill  because of the difficulty in wetting the woolly-hairy leaves of the plants. To achieve an effective kill the following should be considered; Timing of application is also important. If a single application of herbicide is undertaken then a springtime application is best (Dellow 1996), as herbicides are most effective on seedlings and young rosettes, Once plants begins stem elongation, herbicides may be less effective; The hairy leaves of the thistles can reduce herbicide effectiveness through reduced absorption. Therefore it is important to follow the herbicide label and use the recommended rate, application volume and adjuvant; Control will be reduced if plants are stressed. When there is a low density of thistles spot spraying  is preferred (DPI NSW 2019). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information available at http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  When there is a low density of thistles hand chipping is effective. Remove as much of the taproot as possible so that regrowth does not occur. Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Slashing or mowing is not usually effective as plants develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Plants can be mown or slashed before flowering to prevent seed set but this is temporary as plants will regrow and develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed and spread seed.\n\nCompetition and management: Pasture management is the most important part of any thistle control program and maintaining a dense, vigorous and competitive, and vigorous perennial grass pasture provides competition for germinating thistles, reducing seedling establishment. Gaps in the pasture result in an increase in thistle germination and seedling survival so maintaining excellent ground cover at all times is desirable (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nWhile thistles respond to increases in soil fertility (and in particular nitrogen), management of all pasture types should aim to maintain pastures that have a good balance of perennial grass to legume content. Fertiliser application (as determined by a soil test) will improve the vigour of annual and perennial introduced grasses, increasing ground cover and reducing future thistle establishment.\n\nThistles are generally avoided by stock. However goats eat thistles at both the rosette and flowering stage as well as post-flowering. Horses, and sometimes cattle graze the flower which can reduce the amount of seed. The amount eaten depends on the grazing pressure and the amount of other feed available (DPI NSW 2019).  With existing infestations of Illyrian Thistle goats are known to be effective in grazing the rosettes, and also the flower-heads once the plant has elongated. This can be a vital step as it reduces seed production and thus limits recruitment of new thistle plants and also reduces the build up of seed in the soil. The soil seedbank is relatively long-lived (Holst & Allan 1996).\n\nBiological control: Onopordum spp. has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control of all three Onopordum thistles discussed here is under study with three insects released into infestations – a seed head weevil, a stem boring weevil and a crown moth the larvae of which attacks leafstalks, the crown of the rosette and also the roots (Dellow & Holtkamp 2005). The following summary is taken from DPI NSW (2019)\n\nSeed-head weevil. The seed-head weevil, Larinus latus, was released in spring 1992. A single larva is capable of destroying all the seed in a flower head of 3 cm diameter or less and more than one larva may develop in larger heads. This weevil has only one generation per year so it has taken a number of years for populations to grow large enough to destroy most of the seed in a flower head. This insect has reduced seed production by more than 80 per cent.\n\nStem-boring weevil. The stem-boring weevil, Lixus cardui, was first released in November 1993 and is now widely established. The stem-boring weevil is not capable of killing Onopordum thistles. Its activity weakens the plant, makes it less competitive and reduces seed production. This action allows insects such as the seed head weevil to have a greater impact on the plant.\n\nCrown moth. The crown moth, Eublemma amoena, was first released in 1998. There are three adult generations per year, commencing in spring when adults emerge from pupal cells in thistle rosettes. Females lay eggs on leaves and larvae feed in the leaf petioles, causing leaves to shrivel and die. Larvae can also bore into the crown and root of the plant. This may lead to the death of smaller plants. Larvae of subsequent generations feed in the leaves of stems, causing similar leaf shriveling, reducing plant vigour.\n\nRosette weevil. The rosette weevil, Trichosirocalus briesei, was first released in 1997. It is now established in many areas and is starting to have an impact on thistle populations. Adults are 3–5 mm long and a mottled brown colour. There is one generation per year. Adults emerge from a summer dormancy period following autumn rains and commence feeding on rosette leaves. Females lay eggs near the base of the rosette leaves. After hatching, larvae destroy the growing point of the rosette either killing the plant or severely reducing its vigour.\n\nFor further information on the control of Onopordum spp. see Keith Turnbull Research Institute (1998), DPI NSW (2008); DPI NSW 2019; DPIW (2002), and the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia (undated);",
    "bestControlSeason": "Scotch Thistle seeds germinate at any time of year but do so mainly in late summer-autumn and also late winter-spring, and start to form rosettes. A population may therefore consist of plants of many ages (sizes). Plants from late summer-autumn germination will flower and seed the following spring-summer and then die (i.e. they are annuals). Plants from winter or spring germination will also behave as annuals if they have enough chilling to allow stem elongation and flowerhead formation in the late spring. If chilling is insufficient then the rosette will persist over summer and the following winter then elongate, flower and seed then die during the second spring-summer (i.e. they are biennials) (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).\n\nMost Stemless Thistle seeds germinate in autumn after rain and during winter plants develop into small rosettes. The rosettes grow rapidly in spring with flowerheads forming by October-November and seed shedding by December followed by death of the plant. Sometimes late germinating seeds do not have a large enough rosette to flower by the summer and these rosettes over-winter with flowering, seeding and death occurring in the second spring-summer (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).\n\nIllyrian Thistle seeds germinate at any time of year but predominantly in autumn. It forms a rosette during winter with some plants elongating and flowering in the following spring, then seeding and dying or continuing to grow as a rosette through the summer, autumn and winter not flowering until the second spring-summer, then seeding and dying. There seems to be a chilling requirement before flowering can occur (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).",

Treatment should be carried on young plants early in the season when the plant in rosette form, before flowering. Older plants with flowers and seeds are tolerant to herbicides, and plants sprayed when in flower  may set seed and regrow. Plants treated by mechanical means (slashing and mowing) will also regrow and will need follow-up. In addition, slashed or mown cut dead flowering material may develop viable seed and should be removed from sites. Timing it important to kill or manage plants to prevent seed set, with seeds viable for only three years. Reducing the soil seed bank is the goal to reduce or eradicate Stinkwort from an area. Control programs should also address the reasons why Stinkwort has become a weed in a particular area. These include; over-grazed; bare areas;  poor and degraded soil with nutritional deficiencies; soil salinity. Better management and introducing more suitable cover species to consume summer moisture may help.\n\nChemical control: Stinkwort can also be sprayed with herbicide, particularly in the young growth stages (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Older plants are relatively tolerant of herbicides including glyphosate, metsulfuron and hormone herbicides. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Isolated plants or small patches of Stinkwort can be hand-pulled (wearing gloves) before they flower. Plants in flower need to be put in heaps and burned to prevent continued growth and seed production.\n\nMechanical control: Large areas can be cultivated or slashed before flowering, but repeat treatment of regrowth may be needed a few weeks later. Mowing reduces seeding, but is effective only if is cut very close to the ground and repeated. Regrowth often occurs if adequate soil moisture is present.Small areas can be mechanically removed. All dead cut plant material in bud or flower can still form seeds if left on the ground after removal. These cut plants need to be bagged and dumped, or put in heaps and burned to prevent continued seed production. Cultivation of larger plants is only effective if done before flowering.\nCompetition and management: The application of super-phosphate in autumn and winter to stimulate strong pasture growth is an effective way of out-competing and eliminating Stinkwort. Heavy grazing by sheep when the plants are young is also helpful in controlling this weed, but cattle are not as effective.",

    "controlMethods": "The following control methods are those used for Sweet Briar (Rosa rubiginosa), and Dog Rose (Rosa canina) should be treated in the same manner.\n\nNon-chemical control: Smaller plants can be effectively removed by hand removal or grubbing (Muyt 2001) although this method an be labour intensive and time consuming. Established plants can be removed by hand, grubbing, bulldozing, or tractor, and their removal is more effective when the ground is wet (Clements et al. 2005). The crown of larger plants should be fully removed to prevent regrowth, and fruits should be disposed of safely (Muyt 2001). Deep cultivation can also be effective on arable land, and will expose and kill much of the root system, but follow-up cultivation in summer will be necessary to eradicate any remaining roots, and in autumn to prevent seedling growth (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Cultivation can, however, be problematic if plants are large and well established (Clements et al. 2005). Goats and sheep can be used to control larger infestation, and goats can destroy larger plants over time (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Goats are known to provide continuous pressure to the plants that they have a tendency to prefer over many pasture species. An advantage of using goats to control both species is that they can also provide a cash return.\n\nChemical control: Larger plants can be treated with herbicide with a cut-and-paint method, preferably before the fruits ripen in summer and autumn.  Techniques such as ‘cut and paint’ are useful for small numbers of plants. Follow-up treatments may be necessary to prevent regrowth. Alternatively, larger infestations may be foliar sprayed with non-selective or selective herbicides, applied near to the flowering period, and when the plant is actively growing. Selective herbicides appear to be more effective. Cleared sites should always be monitored regularly and any regrowth controlled with follow-up herbicide treatment (Muyt 2001). For removal of this plant from environmentally sensitive areas, a basal bark herbicide treatment can be used (see Clements et al. 2005).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "bestControlSeason": "The seeds of Sweet Briar can germinate at any time of the year, but germination usually occurs in early spring. After experiencing the cold and moist winter period, seed dormancy is broken and warmer weather triggers seedling emergence in a process called cold stratification (Blood 2001). The seeds can remain viable in the soil for up to 4 years. Young seedlings are not very vigorous and can be easily out-competed. Plants are slow to reach maturity with flowering generally only occurring after 3 years of vegetative growth, usually in late spring. Seedling survival may be enhanced on disturbed sites where competition with other plants is minimal. Sweet Briar is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and producing new canes and leaves the following spring. Plants consisting of several hundred canes can develop within a few years if conditions are favourable (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

Large infested areas on agricultural land are best ploughed in spring and cultivated whenever seedlings and regrowth emerge.

Slashing and mowing of mature plants alone will not be effective because the plant regrows readily from the woody base, although this method may be effective when used with herbicide application.\n\nFire: Dense populations can be burnt (following proper controlled burn procedures and regulations) in autumn to open up infestations for follow-up control with herbicides or mechanical control.\n\nChemical control: May also be used, such as spraying regrowth in spring.

Basal barking: Starting at the base of each stem, paint all the way around the stem to a minimum height of 30 centimetres ensuring the treated area is not disturbed for at least 24 hours to allow herbicide uptake. This method can take weeks to months. Stem injection (drill-and-fill): Using a drill or similar tool cut downward at an angle of 45 degrees through the bark to the sap wood.  Immediately apply the herbicide mixture penetrating the trunk to a depth which reaches the sapwood and they must be angled downwards to enable the herbicide to pool. Take care not to overfill the holes. and ensure the treated area is not disturbed for 24 hours to allow herbicide uptake. Treat each stem of the plant with cuts every 7.5 centimetres around the trunk's entire circumference. Create two rows of pockets around the tree (one slightly higher, the next row lower and offset from the first). Cut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment or cut and painted): Cut the stem  no more than 15 centimetres from the ground and immediately apply the herbicide mixture to the cut surface of the stump.

    "origin": "Variegated Thistle (Silybum marianum) originated in the Mediterranean region, south-western Europe, Asia Minor and Russia (i.e. Eurasia) (Navie 2004).",
    "controlMethods": "Variegated Thistle (Silybum marianum) can be controlled by herbicides to kill plants when young, by physical means; grubbing killing if roots are moved, and managed but rarely killed by mechanical means to reduce seed set, and with cultural practices, with grazing animals (caution is and can be toxic to animal in larger quantities). Predominantly a weed of cultivated land on fertile soils, on these areas with existing infestations control will obviously depend on acreage infested and weed density. The best means of control is prevention through good pasture management with of cover of desirable species.\n\nChemical control: Herbicide applications at seedling and rosette stages are most effective, as the plants become more tolerant of the herbicide as they mature. Spray-grazing, where spraying with a herbicide is followed by a short interval of a couple of weeks of no grazing, then grazing the herbicide-affected plants, is also effective in reducing infestations. In any herbicide program the habitat once occupied by the weed needs to be filled with productive, competitive pasture species for ongoing farming benefit and continued weed control (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow 1996). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Small patches of variegated thistle can be chipped with a hoe, provided most of the taproot is also removed.\n\nMechanical control: Slashing or mowing may reduce seed set, but is ineffective at killing variegated thistles. Mowing plants of Variegated Thistle before flowers open is also effective but the cut plants, now wilted, can cause nitrate poisoning if eaten by livestock, especially if conditions are moist (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nCompetition and management: The best defence against invasion by Variegated Thistle (Silybum marianum) on agricultural lands is to maintain healthy perennial pasture with good ground cover at all times, especially in summer going into autumn to prevent seedling establishment. On the highly fertile sites where this species is often found, summer-growing pasture species such as Phalaris and lucerne are effective in out-competing germinating and establishing thistle seedlings. Winter annual species such as ryegrass and clover generally are not effective (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nCultivation of the ground when young seedlings are present will kill those seedlings, but establishing a competitive pasture is then vital for continued control of the species.\n\nGrazing by goats has been shown to be effective against Variegated Thistle as they selectively graze leaves and heads that are setting seed and thus can reduce overall seedset and prevent buildup of the soil seed store. Sheep grazing is ineffective (Holst & Allan 1996).\n\nQuick grazing with high stocking rates of sheep in autumn just after thistles have germinated will greatly reduce seedling numbers. Grazing must be managed carefully however as overgrazing may weaken the pasture, allowing the thistles to colonise bare areas and successfully compete with the weakened grass.\n\nBiological control: Variegated Thistle has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allowed activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. The receptacle weevil Rhinocyllus conicus has been released in Victoria but its extent and effectiveness is unknown.   It is likely that this will be at its most effective in large infestations so populations of the weevil can build up (see Bruzzese et al. 1998).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Seed of Variegated Thistle (Silybum marianum) mainly germinates after autumn rain, especially if the summer has been dry, but some germination will also occur in late winter and spring. Growth of the rosette stage is rapid during winter and early spring with large densely-leaved plants forming which block out light from pasture species. Stems elongate in spring with flowering starting about late October and continuing to early summer with plants dying after seed shed. If there is summer rain and temperatures are suitable flowering may continue over summer and into autumn, especially in southern Victoria and Tasmania. Plants germinating and forming a rosette after about August will over-winter before elongating and flowering (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Groves & Kaye 1989).\n\nSeed may remain viable in the soil for at least 9 years (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",

As seed germination can occur all year round, pulling of seedlings should be maintained throughout the year. The numerous seedlings compete vigorously with each other, therefore it may be more efficient to wait until most plant have been killed through sibling competition before pulling (Weedbusters 2004). Cleared sites should be replanted quickly with dense, low growing native shrubs to help prevent seedling regrowth (Weedbusters 2004). The carpet of seedlings that emerge, normally after removal of the mother plant(s) can be manually removed, smothered with mulch, or black plastic, or sprayed with herbicide.\n\nChemical control: Larger plants can be cut close to the ground and treated with herbicide to prevent re-shooting, preferably in summer-autumn just after fruiting (Muyt 2001). Frequent removal of shoots produced from the stump may be required (Sigg 2004). Plants can also be treated with drill and fill / stem injection method in spring or early summer, before fruit mature in early autumn with drilled holes or cuts made into the sapwood and filled with herbicide within 15 seconds of making the cut (Muyt 2001).

    "controlMethods": "Variations in dormancy and germination times of bulbs, bulbils and seeds of Crow Garlic make it well adapted for survival and difficult to control. A management program integrating grazing, cultivation and chemical control extending over at least five years may be required to eradicate this weed. A priority should be to prevent formation of aerial bulbils and seed to avoid further spread of infestations.\n\nChemical control: Crow Garlic can be killed by a number of herbicides but, as with cultivation, treatments must be repeated for several years to ensure all bulbs have germinated (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). A number of cheap herbicides routinely used in cereal cropping are effective against Crow Garlic in South Australia. It has disappeared from some areas since the introduction of sulfonylurea herbicides in the 1980s (Government of South Australia 2015).  A selection of herbicides are listed in Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001) and, Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Removing individual or small plant id possible. However, all bulbs and bulbets should be removed and plants should be removed before bulbils drop from the flowering / bulbil heads.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation can kill the majority of plants but needs to be repeated for several years to effectively eradicate the population. Cultivation is best used in conjunction with chemical treatments.\n\nCompetition and management: Heavy grazing by sheep or cattle achieves this but does not kill the underground bulbs or eliminate established infestations. Care should be taken due to the risk of stock poisoning. Frequent tillage in late autumn and spring reduces the food reserves of the bulbs, but care must be taken to avoid dragging bulbs to new areas (Fisher 2007).",

Grazing and mowing are not successful in controlling this weed because it can regrow from the deep root system (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nChemical control: Rosette-stage plants are susceptible some herbicides but mature plants can show resistance. Older plants can be sprayed with selected herbicides in non-crop areas (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Some chemical control methods are available for cereal crops and pastures. Shoots of cut-leaf Mignonette are easily killed, but translocation of herbicides through the root system is limited and regrowth from the roots occurs. In heavily infested paddocks, the best available herbicide treatments only suppress the weed and yield reduction occurs until the infestation is controlled by repeated spraying (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nBiological control: Cut-leaf Mignonette has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process.

Although selective and reasonably effective it also is time consuming and sometimes impractical. Selected herbicides can be effective against Bulbil Watsonia without having an impact on co-occurring native species but timing is crucial. Herbicide application should take place when flowering stems are elongating and the parent corm is exhausted (see Moore & Fletcher 1994; Brown 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual control: Plants may be hand pulled to remove the corm in winter and spring when the ground is soft and wet. Plants that cannot be destroyed should have their stems removed before bulbils are dispersed. Hand removal however, is often impractical and the resulting soil disturbance can facilitate invasion of other weeds. Heavy infestations on agricultural land can be rotary hoed or ploughed deeply in late autumn and the corms raked from the surface and removed or burnt. The spread of Bulbil Watsonia can be controlled by grazing as livestock eat the young growth. Pigs eat the bulbils, and can be used in an eradication program (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Faithfull et al. 2007).

    "controlMethods": "For the best results, African Lovegrass requires an integrated control approach as part of overall pasture management. Maintaining a healthy pasture will help to reduce the chances of African Lovegrass infestation, as it quickly establishes in bare areas. Effective control also largely depends on preventing seed spread to clean areas (Land Protection 2006). Check with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for African Lovegrass control.\n\nNon-chemical control: Prevention is the best means of control. To reduce the chance of African Lovegrass establishing you can avoid bringing in hay, grain, or silage from African Lovegrass areas. Also limit animal movement from from infested areas into clean paddocks or quarantine new stock for at least 10 days if moving from infested areas. Maintain good weed hygiene for vehicles and machinery and  before coming onto your property.\n\nEarly detection: controlling any new African Lovegrass infestations as soon as it appears should stop areas becoming infested.\n\nPasture management: Maintain good pastures and weed management practices.  Physical disturbance such as slashing and ploughing are not recommended, as they can promote seed spread and re-infestation. However, physical disturbance followed by immediate replacement dense pastures will prevent African Lovegrass from germinating. If any seedling appear in or on the margins of the pasture and these can be controlled and chipped out or with application of herbicides before they flower. When chipping out the plant, ensure that the entire tussock crown is removed, as this will prevent regrowth (Silcock 2005; Land Protection 2006).\n\nGrazing: African Lovegrass is only palatable to livestock when very young before flowering for a limited time, and quickly forms a tough unpalatable flowering tussock and sets seed. Therefore, heavy grazing of young African Lovegrass is recommended as this is when it is the most palatable and nutritious to livestock, unfortunately at a time when feed is generally available from more palatable species. Grazing can stop African Lovegrass seeding, but should not be the main control strategy (DPI NSW 20219). As cattle can spread viable seed, they should be prevented from grazing on African Lovegrass while it is in seed, or quarantined before moving them into clean paddocks. Re-sowing of desirable pastures species may be the best option in heavily infested areas (Land Protection 2006).\n\nFire: Using fire as a management tool is not usually recommended for African Lovegrass, as it recovers faster than other species and its growth is usually enhanced following burning. However, applying herbicides or heavily grazing the fresh regrowth after a cool fire can help to reduce the large tussocks and encourage the diversification of better pasture species (Silcock 2005; Land Protection 2006).\n\nChemical control: African Lovegrass is difficult to destroy with herbicides but non-selective herbicides can be used on roadsides and spot infestations. Control in pasture depends on management of grazing pressures and appropriate use of herbicide (Government of South Australia 2021). Herbicides can be used as part of integrated management, but foliar application should only be conducted when the plant is green and actively growing. Residual herbicides are best applied from July to December, as this will prevent seed set in the following summer (Land Protection 2006). Spot spraying small or individual plants minimizes soil disturbance.  Herbicides are most effective in combination with healthy, competitive pastures. DPI NSW (2019) state that spraying as a single control method is only effective where African Lovegrass is selectively removed from a strong pasture. Burn heavy infestations before spraying the regrowth. Flupropanate gives the  best control of African Lovegrass. It can take three months to have a noticeable effect and up to 18 months to kill the plant. Avoid spraying in winter. Observe grazing withholding periods. Glyphosate will also kill African Lovegrass. Apply to actively growing plants in spring and summer. Use a glyphosate based herbicide to kill any regrowth.\n\nSee Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018); DPI NSW (2019); the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

The key to managing thistles is reduce or prevent plants setting viable seed, and in doing so the following year’s population will be greatly reduced (DPI NSW 2019)\n\nChemical control: Herbicide control of these three Onopordum species can be very effective and is an essential part of the overall management of these thistles and are used on large or dense infestations applying . However, plants can be tricky  to kill  because of the difficulty in wetting the woolly-hairy leaves of the plants. To achieve an effective kill the following should be considered; Timing of application is also important. If a single application of herbicide is undertaken then a springtime application is best (Dellow 1996), as herbicides are most effective on seedlings and young rosettes, Once plants begins stem elongation, herbicides may be less effective; The hairy leaves of the thistles can reduce herbicide effectiveness through reduced absorption. Therefore it is important to follow the herbicide label and use the recommended rate, application volume and adjuvant; Control will be reduced if plants are stressed. When there is a low density of thistles spot spraying  is preferred (DPI NSW 2019).

Remove as much of the taproot as possible so that regrowth does not occur. Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Slashing or mowing is not usually effective as plants develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Plants can be mown or slashed before flowering to prevent seed set but this is temporary as plants will regrow and develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed and spread seed.\n\nCompetition and management: Pasture management is the most important part of any thistle control program and maintaining a dense, vigorous and competitive, and vigorous perennial grass pasture provides competition for germinating thistles, reducing seedling establishment. Gaps in the pasture result in an increase in thistle germination and seedling survival so maintaining excellent ground cover at all times is desirable (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nWhile thistles respond to increases in soil fertility (and in particular nitrogen), management of all pasture types should aim to maintain pastures that have a good balance of perennial grass to legume content. Fertiliser application (as determined by a soil test) will improve the vigour of annual and perennial introduced grasses, increasing ground cover and reducing future thistle establishment.\n\nThistles are generally avoided by stock. However goats eat thistles at both the rosette and flowering stage as well as post-flowering. Horses, and sometimes cattle graze the flower which can reduce the amount of seed. The amount eaten depends on the grazing pressure and the amount of other feed available (DPI NSW 2019).  With existing infestations of Illyrian Thistle goats are known to be effective in grazing the rosettes, and also the flower-heads once the plant has elongated. This can be a vital step as it reduces seed production and thus limits recruitment of new thistle plants and also reduces the build up of seed in the soil. The soil seedbank is relatively long-lived (Holst & Allan 1996).\n\nBiological control: Onopordum spp. has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control of all three Onopordum thistles discussed here is under study with three insects released into infestations – a seed head weevil, a stem boring weevil and a crown moth the larvae of which attacks leafstalks, the crown of the rosette and also the roots (Dellow & Holtkamp 2005). The following summary is taken from DPI NSW (2019)\n\nSeed-head weevil. The seed-head weevil, Larinus latus, was released in spring 1992. A single larva is capable of destroying all the seed in a flower head of 3 cm diameter or less and more than one larva may develop in larger heads. This weevil has only one generation per year so it has taken a number of years for populations to grow large enough to destroy most of the seed in a flower head. This insect has reduced seed production by more than 80 per cent.\n\nStem-boring weevil. The stem-boring weevil, Lixus cardui, was first released in November 1993 and is now widely established. The stem-boring weevil is not capable of killing Onopordum thistles. Its activity weakens the plant, makes it less competitive and reduces seed production. This action allows insects such as the seed head weevil to have a greater impact on the plant.\n\nCrown moth. The crown moth, Eublemma amoena, was first released in 1998. There are three adult generations per year, commencing in spring when adults emerge from pupal cells in thistle rosettes. Females lay eggs on leaves and larvae feed in the leaf petioles, causing leaves to shrivel and die. Larvae can also bore into the crown and root of the plant. This may lead to the death of smaller plants. Larvae of subsequent generations feed in the leaves of stems, causing similar leaf shriveling, reducing plant vigour.\n\nRosette weevil. The rosette weevil, Trichosirocalus briesei, was first released in 1997. It is now established in many areas and is starting to have an impact on thistle populations. Adults are 3–5 mm long and a mottled brown colour. There is one generation per year. Adults emerge from a summer dormancy period following autumn rains and commence feeding on rosette leaves. Females lay eggs near the base of the rosette leaves. After hatching, larvae destroy the growing point of the rosette either killing the plant or severely reducing its vigour.\n\nFor further information on the control of Onopordum spp. see Keith Turnbull Research Institute (1998), DPI NSW (2008); DPI NSW 2019; DPIW (2002), and the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia (undated);",
    "bestControlSeason": "Scotch Thistle seeds germinate at any time of year but do so mainly in late summer-autumn and also late winter-spring, and start to form rosettes. A population may therefore consist of plants of many ages (sizes). Plants from late summer-autumn germination will flower and seed the following spring-summer and then die (i.e. they are annuals). Plants from winter or spring germination will also behave as annuals if they have enough chilling to allow stem elongation and flowerhead formation in the late spring. If chilling is insufficient then the rosette will persist over summer and the following winter then elongate, flower and seed then die during the second spring-summer (i.e. they are biennials) (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).\n\nMost Stemless Thistle seeds germinate in autumn after rain and during winter plants develop into small rosettes. The rosettes grow rapidly in spring with flowerheads forming by October-November and seed shedding by December followed by death of the plant. Sometimes late germinating seeds do not have a large enough rosette to flower by the summer and these rosettes over-winter with flowering, seeding and death occurring in the second spring-summer (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).\n\nIllyrian Thistle seeds germinate at any time of year but predominantly in autumn. It forms a rosette during winter with some plants elongating and flowering in the following spring, then seeding and dying or continuing to grow as a rosette through the summer, autumn and winter not flowering until the second spring-summer, then seeding and dying. There seems to be a chilling requirement before flowering can occur (Groves & Kaye 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).",

This is because mechanical control methods will actually encourage its spread as vegetative fragments will form new plants (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). All control methods need to be thorough and either kill or remove all of the plants to prevent regrowth from stem pieces (Jordan 2007). After mechanical removal, plants can be destroyed by drying and burning or burying (Miller & Schultz 1998; Johnson undated). Control through water level fluctuations may be possible in some situations, e.g., flushing or draining channels or dams (Stephens & Dowling 2002; Sainty & Jacobs 2003; Washington State Department of Ecology 2003). Long-term management is likely to involve both increased and variable water flows and reduced nutrient loading (Johnson undated).\n\nChemical control is possible, but herbicide treatments need to be approved and are limited by environmental constraints when used within water bodies, wetlands, water sources and irrigation systems (Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Peirce & Pratt 2002; Washington State Department of Ecology 2003; Weber 2003; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food undated).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nAquatic weeds can be extremely expensive to eradicate and so prevention is better than cure, especially with these kinds of plants (Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2006). Preventing this weed escaping into water ways is the best way of managing it and so aquarium or pond plants should never be dumped or grown in water ways (Johnson undated; see also Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2006). It is also important to encourage the growing of more suitable aquatic plants in ponds and aquaria (CRC 2005; Lawrence et al. 2005). Dense Waterweed is prohibited and banned from sale in several states and territories (Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2006 undated; Johnson undated).\n\nIntegrated management plans and control measures for Dense Waterweed are outlined by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water (2008). Planning and implementation of an integrated control program aims at eradicating all existing populations and preventing future infestations of Dense Waterweed.

    "controlMethods": "False Yellowhead (Dittrichia viscosa) can be controlled by physical and mechanical means, and herbicides. Older plants with flowers treated with herbicide may produce seed, so may need to be treated by mechanical means. Plants with flowers that slashed or mown may also produce seed and need to be bagged and dumped, or put in heaps and burned to prevent seed production and subsequently dispersal and spread in the area. Timing is important to kill or manage plants to prevent seed set. Seeds are viable for extended periods able to endure many years of dormancy if deprived of light. Because there are relatively few False Yellowhead infestations, it can be eradicated before it becomes established, and it is highly recommended that any new outbreaks should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Do not try to control False Yellowhead without expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: False Yellowhead can be sprayed with herbicide. In Western Australia spraying some roadside infestations of False Yellowhead has been encouraging with good kill rates helped by the clumping of plants, although it has been important to spray before seed set. Occasionally, applying herbicide to the stump has been used to treat larger plants. (CRC 2003)\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Before False Yellowhead flowers, isolated plants or small patches can be hand-pulled (wearing gloves), or use a fork to remove plants, minimising soil disturbance. Follow-up manual weeding of previously sprayed patches of any False Yellowhead plants is recommended to minimising disturbance to the soil and reducing the likelihood of germination of False Yellowhead weed seeds in the soil seedbank.\n\nMechanical control: Small areas can be mechanically removed. Plants in flower must be burnt as seed will develop from the nutrient reserves in the stem if left on the ground. In roadside cases some control has been achieved by regular mowing before flowering and seeding. However, protective clothing must be worn because mowing can release the irritating oils that are stored in the leaves (CRC 2003).\nCompetition and management: Cultivation of larger plants is only effective if done before flowering during dry weather.

Larger patches may be cultivated, but subsequent pulling may be required to remove seedlings in following seasons (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can be useful if applied to the leaves at the rosette stage, before flowering when actively growing in autumn, winter and spring  (Remaley 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nBiological control: Great Mullein is not currently a Target for Biological Control in Australia. Two insect species, the European Curculionid Weevil (Gymnaetron tetrum) and the Mullein Moth (Cucullia verbasci) have been tested in the United States and have possible biological control implications for Great Mullein (Remaley 1998).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "bestControlSeason": "Seeds of Great Mullein germinate in autumn and spring, and plants form a rosette of leaves and large taproot during the first summer. Vegetative growth continues, where the rosette and roots increase in size, until temperatures decline in autumn and winter. During the second spring and summer, plants reach maturity and quickly flower, produce seed, and die (Remaley 1998). It is able to self pollinate if cross pollination does not occur (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "controlMethods": "Creeping Knapweed (Rhaponticum repens) extensive perennial root system resists control efforts (Pritchard 1992). Once established this weed is difficult to control (especially in crops) and eradicate (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Lloyd 2006). Observing equipment hygiene protocols is extremely important to avoid spread of propagules to new areas or clean properties (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998). Successful weed control requires follow up after the initial efforts. This means looking for and killing regrowth or new seedlings. Using a combination of control methods is usually more successful.\n\nChemical control: Creeping Knapweed can often be effectively chemically controlled by using various herbicides (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Laufenberg et al. 2005; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food, undated). Early detection and eradication of small patches using herbicides and follow-up treatments is recommended (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998).  Small incursions on a property can be destroyed by prompt spot spraying. Please see DPI NSW (2019); Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018); the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  Young seedling can be chipped out removing roots, however, only used for new and small infestations.\n\nMechanical control:  It may be possible to eliminate Creeping Knapweed through repeated cultivation over several years, but it must be carried out at intervals of no more than 3 weeks during the growing season. However, this will seldom be practical and may actually spread the weed rather than weaken infestations. This method of mechanical control is best avoided in pasture and broadacre cropping situations. Repeated deep cultivation is, however, used for control in vineyards and orchards but can still result in pieces of root being moved to clean areas. In areas where lucerne, clover or perennial pastures can be grown, Creeping Knapweed is controlled by competition and regular cutting or grazing (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\nCompetition and management: The most effective control is to prevent the introduction and spread of the species. This is assisted by advice and legislative declarations of weed status. Western Australia and the Northern Territory similarly prohibit the introduction and movement of plants or seed, and the eradication of any infestations that might be found (van Rangelrooy 1993; Lloyd 2006; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food, undated).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Creeping Knapweed (Rhaponticum repens) is a perennial with long-lived roots. Germination occurs during autumn and winter, with seedlings emerging in winter and spring to initially form rosettes, most of which do not produce flowering stems in the first summer. During this stage the plants develop an extensive and deep root system both laterally and vertically (the tap root may extend many metres down). In undisturbed plants, aerial growth usually dies off by autumn. New aerial shoots and growth from horizontal roots and stem bases develop in the following spring and into summer. These plants produce flowering stems by early summer, and flowering occurs during spring to autumn. Plants disturbed in late summer or autumn can continue to produce new shoots into winter. After seeding, the top growth dies off in late summer or autumn. Plants are dormant during winter. Cultivation stimulates new shoot growth from the roots, so active growth can be observed throughout the summer and autumn until the top growth is killed by cooler winter temperatures (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Wilding et al. 1986; Pritchard 1992; McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "controlMethods": "Due to the plant's limited distribution as a weed in Australia, there has been little scope for research into successful control methods.\n\nIts fibrous root system makes manual control by hand pulling or digging difficult. Also, the soil disturbance associated with such manual control usually results in regrowth from stem fragments and seed (CRC 2003). Intense grazing by sheep, especially in spring, will suppress the growth and subsequent flowering of Heather and may even result in the elimination the plant after a number of years (Gimingham 1960). Light grazing and mechanical slashing encourage Heather to put on new growth but will not kill the plants (CRC 2003). In New Zealand, herbicide is used to control Heather; however, there are no herbicides currently registered for use on Heather in Australia (CRC 2003).\n\nHeather responds well to sporadic non-intense fires that rejuvenate older plants and stimulate the germination of soil stored seed (Gimingham 1960; Webb 1989, Legg et al. 1992).\n\nThe potential for biological control of Heather in New Zealand has been investigated since the late 1980s (Syrett 1995). Unfortunately the beetle predator released for this purpose in 1996 has had minimal impact (CRC 2003).\n\nA range of integrated control methods, coupled with routine follow-up monitoring and control, will need to be carried out for several years to successfully manage infestations of Heather.\n\nControl of Heather should not be undertaken without specialist advice and assistance from your local council, or state or territory weed management agency.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "controlMethods": "A variety of control methods have been successfully used against Kochia (Bassia scoparia) in Australia. Methods used in the eradication of Kochia from Western Australia include the application of herbicide, grazing, burning of large seeding plants to destroy formed seed, and mechanical removal (Dodd 2004). These methods proved to be very successful with most infestations being eradicated within 2 years of starting the control (Dodd 2004). In some instances in North America, Kochia has become resistant to sulfonurea and triazine herbicides (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control:  Herbicides were delivered from the ground and aerially for larger infestations (CRC 2003). See DPIRD (2020) & DPI NSW (2019) for list of chemical controls and the rates.  Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control:  High densities of sheep were used to provide extreme grazing pressure that caused defoliation of large plants and destruction of seedlings. Grubbing, the physical removal of plants from the ground, was also conducted where appropriate. Flaming, where plants are burnt by a flame thrower or similar, was used on mature, seeding plants to kill the seeds (CRC 2003). in Tasmania in 1995,1997 and 1998, when seeds were discovered as a contaminant of imported carrot seed, hand pulling was used to remove all plants, which numbered less than 50 in each of the infestations. Although some plants set seed at some sites, no seedlings were found, possibly because of the herbicides used to control other weeds (CRC 2003).\n\nDo not try to control Kochia without expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).

Lacy Ragweed survives and spreads by spreading root-stocks and also by seeds.  Herbicides, however, give good control in pastures, suppressing the Lacy Ragweed and allowing pasture species to compete effectively. Slashing and mowing can be used, but is not effectively controlled by cultivation. In fact, it usually makes the infestation worse by spreading pieces of the perennial root and stimulating development from root buds. .\n\nChemical control: Spraying is usually performed at the budding stage of growth (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Herbicides, allow control but such treatments may need to be repeated over several years to prevent re-colonisation from dormant seeds in the soil (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In South Australia  Ragweeds are difficult to control requiring repeated application of herbicides such as triclopyr (Government of South Australia 2014). Foliar spray is used in New South Wales and South Australia, with information available at DPI NSW (2019) & Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018).\nPlease also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Where feasible, plants can be pulled by hand. However, contact with flowering plants and pollen should be avoided by those prone to allergies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical control: Lacy Ragweed survives mowing, trampling, grazing and cultivation due to the longevity and dormancy of its seed. Plants may be slashed or mown prior to setting seed (i.e. at the early flowering stage or immediately prior to flowering). Checks should be carried out to ensure flowering is prevented in any re-growth that occurs. Regrowth may occur from soil seed banks and these plants must also be controlled, normally with herbicides. \nCaution If plants have set seed , mechanical methods may make infestation worse, spreading seeds. Always use property hygiene practices when operating in areas infested with Lacy Ragweed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCultural: Lacy Ragweed is not effectively controlled by cultivation. In fact, it usually makes the infestation worse by spreading pieces of the perennial root and stimulating development from root buds. Young plant that have not developed a root system could be hand pulled.\nFire: With heavy infestations, opportunistic burning can be a useful tool in controlling Annual Ragweed if paddocks have not been overgrazed. Burning needs to be done when adequate soil moisture will allow good grass cover to grow back.\nBiological control: The Ragweeds has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process.

    "origin": "According to most literature, Lippia is native to the South American (Richardson 1994; USDA 2003), and naturalised elsewhere. However, as a widely cultivated species, the origins of this species are not clear. For example, Lippia has recently been recorded as having only a tropical to subtropical world distribution (Dellow et al. 2001) but this is not confirmed by its current distribution across a large range of climatic types (Leigh & Walton 2004).",
    "controlMethods": "Long-term control of Lippia is best achieved through an integrated approach involving use of herbicides, mechanical control, pasture improvement and grazing management (Motley et al. 2001). However, it may be difficult to implement control strategies in some cases, as there are many situations where conventional control methods are either uneconomic or impractical (Lucy et al. 1995). Although the species has been subject to years of trials by landholders and researchers, a comprehensive manual of treatment methods for all situations has not been developed. For further information about control methods for Lippia see; DPI NSW (2019); Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Queensland Government, (2020).\n\nChemical control: A broad-leaved weed that occurs in pasture situations, some herbicides can be used to reduce Lippia infestations without harming competitive grasses. No herbicide will effectively suppress growth in the long term. Due to Lippia's ability to rapidly recover and spread. Multiple herbicide applications within a season have been shown to give better suppression than single applications. However, herbicide control can become costly in areas with large infestations. Herbicide control is not suitable in riparian areas due to risk of polluting waterways. Also, herbicides should not be applied immediately after rain or if heavy rain is forecast. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control, in paddocks short-term control can be achieved where infestations can be ploughed or harrowed. This method is not practical if Lippia is growing in riparian zones (such as creekbanks) due to high risk of erosion and soil loss. Not usually a problem in cropping areas as can be readily ploughed into soil. However, machinery easily spreads Lippia, so machinery working in infested areas should be washed down before leaving area. When Lippia is actively growing and soil moisture levels are good, herbicide can be used in conjunction with mechanical control to give better results.\n\nGrazing management, DPI NSW (2019) state as a general rule, do not graze new pasture grasses until they have become well established and are producing tillers. Sensible grazing in the establishment year can promote tillering and increased seed production.\n\nBiological control: There are no biological control agents currently available for Lippia, and to date it has not been targeted for research. (Leigh & Walton 2004)",
    "bestControlSeason": "Lippia flowers anytime in the spring-summer-autumn period given favourable soil moisture conditions (Lucy et al. 1995; Dellow et al. 2001). Flowering can be triggered by rain or flooding at any time during this period (Lucy et al. 1995). Lippia can self- and cross-pollinate (McCosker 1994) resulting in a high percentage seed set and maintenance of sufficient genetic variation to adapt and rapidly colonise new environments (Kumar & Dutt 1989). Studies on the size of the seed bank and longevity of Lippia seeds in the soil are required.\n\nGermination can occur under a wide range of conditions, and a viable seed bank remains around a parent plant even after the plant's removal (McCosker 1994; Lucy et al. 1995). Research suggest that seeds of Lippia may possess an effective drought survival mechanism involving enhanced germination from the seed bank as a result of alternate drying and wetting (McCosker 1994; Leigh. & Walton 2004).",

    "controlMethods": "It is difficult to control because of its long flowering season, prolific seed production, the longevity of its seed bank, a variable life cycle, and the ability to germinate at any time of the year provided there is moisture available. The best defence against invasion of Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) on agricultural lands is maintaining healthy perennial pasture with good ground cover in summer going into autumn to prevent seedling establishment. With existing infestations control will depend on acreage infested and weed density.\n\nChemical control: Herbicide application in springtime when the first buds are obvious in the centre of the rosette has been shown to be effective. The least satisfactory time of application of herbicides is mid-winter, and when the stems are elongating (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow 1996). Springtime non-lethal herbicide application combined with grazing is the best of the integrated strategies (Shea et al. 2006).\n\nAn infestation may contain plants at various stages, including seedlings, small rosettes, large rosettes, flower-stem growth, and full flower and the type of herbicide used will depend on the stages of growth in an infestation. The best time to spray nodding thistle is when the plant is in the seedling and small rosette stage. Control of an infestation in pasture may require spraying in spring and autumn.\n\nResistance of Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) to some herbicides has been shown to develop in New Zealand with continued use. The only effective means of avoiding the development of resistance is to reduce dependence on herbicides for control, especially by using pasture management to reduce weed establishment in summer going into autumn (Harrington 1996). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand remove isolated plants or small populations through spring and early summer.\n\nCultivation of the soil will encourage germination that can be followed up with herbicide application.\n\nGrubbing: where the number of plants involved is small, removal by grubbing is feasible. The thistle should be grubbed out ( This method requires weeds to be dug out using a mattock or chip hoe) to a depth of at least 5 cm.\n\nSlashing: The Slashing or cutting of plants in bud or then early flowering stage can be used to delay flowering or seeding, but will likely result in additional stem growth (coppicing) from the stem or rootstock, and must be followed up by measures to kill the whole plant. If the plant is in full flower, heads should be collected and burnt since seed may mature on the cut stalks.\n\nGrazing management, Grazing by goats has been shown to be effective against Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) as they selectively graze flower-heads and heads setting seed and thus can reduce overall seed-set. They rarely graze rosettes. Sheep grazing is an ineffective control method (Holst & Allan 1996). A combination of seasonal 'crash-grazing', in either autumn or spring, at up to four times the normal grazing pressure, combined with biological control agents, is highly effective (Shea et al. 2006).\n\nBiological control: Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Three biocontrol agents (one a Root-crown Weevil Trichosirocalus mortadelo, and two flowerhead feeding insects Urophora solstitialis and Rhinocyllus conicus) have been released in an effort to control Nodding Thistle. The Root-crown Weevil is the most effective as it attacks a life stage critical to the thistle's invasive success in Australia while the seed feeders do not (Shea et al. 2006).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Populations of Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) always contain plants of mixed ages and sizes, and all plants require low temperature vernalization (exposure to cold) at the rosette stage to initiate elongation and flowering. Most plants germinate in autumn, form a rosette which sits over winter and then as the weather warms the stem elongates. Flowering is from November through summer to as late as the following autumn. After seed is shed the plant dies (Groves & Kaye 1989; Popay & Medd 1990; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nLarge rosettes need shorter vernalization periods than do small rosettes so plants forming a large rosette before the onset of winter will flower earlier the following summer whereas small rosettes will only flower if they have received adequate length of cold If not they may continue through the summer as a rosette, experience more cold the following winter and flower the second summer. Any seeds not germinating and establishing a rosette until spring may flower in the following autumn if an adequate cold period is experienced, or the rosette may carry through the following winter and flower in the second summer (Groves & Kaye 1989; Popay & Medd 1990; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",

    "controlMethods": "Control of Bridal Veil (Asparagus declinatus) is possible by chemical and mechanical means. Other less common control methods include grazing and fire. Grazing by cattle and sheep can successfully keep Bridal Veil at low levels and prevent fruit production. Biological control options are not available for Bridal Veil.\n\nChemical control: Applying herbicide is the most common method of controlling Bridal Veil. Herbicide is most effective when sprayed during the winter to early spring flowering period when plants are actively growing. However, leaves of Bridal Veil are fine and waxy which can make herbicide application difficult, as the chemicals do not adhere to the leaves very well. Trials by the Kangaroo Island Asparagus Weeds Committee have shown that emulsifiable vegetable oil mixed with the herbicide will help the chemicals to stick (Lawrie 2006).\n\nHowever, because Bridal Veil often grows in areas of native vegetation, it is particularly important to avoid contact with desirable plants or soil near tree root zones. Isolated plants can be treated with a recommended herbicide applied by spot spraying. As infestations become larger, a strategically staged approach for removal is advisable to ensure that treated areas are not re-infested (CRC 2003). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical removal of Bridal Veil involves carefully excavating around and under the tuberous root mass and then levering it out with hand tools. This control method is only effective if all of the tuberous root mass, including the rhizomes, are dug up and removed from the site (Lawrie 2006). This may be possible for new, small infestations or as a follow-up after several years of herbicide control of a larger infestation. Slashing the stems and leaves may prevent fruit production and slowly deplete root reserves but it will not eradicate an infestation (CRC 2003). Small infestations can be controlled by hand pulling where practical.\n\nHand pulling can only be used for small plants and infestation. The rhizomes (main growing points at the top of the soil where the stem emerge) should be removed when hand pulling.  If the plant breaks leaving any or all the rhizome, plants will immediately regrow if conditions allow.\n\nMechanical control: However, for large dense infestations where little to no native plants remain mechanical removal of above ground parts parts may help.\n\nCompetition and management: Grazing can provide some control. Sheep will graze on the new shoots and are more likely to chew it down than cattle. However, Bridal Veil is not a preferred food source for sheep and cattle and so grazing should be considered as an opportunistic control method and not relied upon to eradicate an infestation (Lawrie 2006).\n\nDisposal: When removing material off-site, rhizomes can regrow and re-shoot if not killed. Any rhizomes that come in to contact with the ground, on or off site, will re-shoot. Material can be composted or solarised and the same methods should be used for the fruits containing seeds, as these can germinate and grow in to new plants. If the plant is being removed from gardens, dispose of it through local government kerbside collection or tip facilities. Fruiting shoot material should be bagged immediately to avoid it being dropped or dispersed by birds. Root material (which can survive being dried for long periods) and seeds should not be composted or mulched (CRC 2003).\n\nFire: Fire can also be useful in reducing above ground biomass of larger infestations. The effectiveness of fire as a control method is yet to be verified. Previous experiments using fire have had little impact on the underground tuber mat due to difficulties in maintaining fire intensity. In some high rainfall regions of South Australia, it has been observed that tubers grow in the leaf litter. A high intensity fire may ‘cook’ and ultimately destroy these tubers (Lawrie 2006).\n\nBiological control: At present there are no biological control agents for Bridal Veil in Australia (Lawrie 2006).\n\nFor further information see the Asparagus Weeds Best Practice Management Manual (available at https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/-/media/OEH/Corporate-Site/Documents/Animals-and-plants/Pests-and-weeds/asparagus-weeds-management-manual-130486.pdf ).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Bridal Veil shoots begin to appear after the first autumn rains, usually during April or May, and scramble across the ground but do not generally climb to the same extent as Bridal Creeper (Asparagus asparagoides). The onset of cool winter weather sees shoots form dense foliage becoming deep green in colour. Above ground plant matter begins to whither and dies off when temperatures rise, usually during November-December, though drying fruit has been observed to stay on the plant through to January. Over the hot summer months Bridal Veil senesces back to the underground tuberous root mat (Lawrie 2006).\n\nThere is little knowledge of the growth rate of Bridal Veil. Based on research conducted by Raymond (1996a) it could be inferred that it has a similar growth rate to Bridal Creeper (Asparagus asparagoides). The underground, tuberous root mat ensures that during periods of unfavourable conditions (such as during a dry season or extended drought period) the plant can draw on nutrients and moisture contained within the storage organs (Pate & Dixon 1982). Observations made on Bridal Veil vigour and fruiting capacity during the 2002 drought in South Australia found that during this period, foliage turned a pale yellow colour and growth rate and vigour was reduced. Similarly, fruiting levels were lower than average during that season suggesting drought conditions adversely affect Bridal Veil (Bass & Lawrie 2003).",

Hand pulling, subsurface cutting, and use of draglines may give useful temporary control, but it is essential to minimise the movement of stem fragments. Any material removed must be disposed of carefully. In small dams it has been successfully controlled by covering the water with black plastic sheeting for several weeks (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Weber 2003; EPPO 2008).\n\nChemical control: In general, herbicides give effective control in most situations.

    "controlMethods": "Perennial Ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) survives and spreads by spreading root-stocks and also by seeds. Herbicides can effectively be used to control\n\nChemical control: Herbicides, allow control but such treatments may need to be repeated over several years to prevent re-colonisation from dormant seeds in the soil (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In South Australia Perennial Ragweed is difficult to control requiring repeated application of herbicides such as triclopyr (Government of South Australia 2014). Foliar spray is used in New South Wales and South Australia, with information avalible at DPI NSW (2019) & Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA. (2018). Please also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Where feasible, plants can be pulled by hand. However, contact with flowering plants and pollen should be avoided by those prone to allergies.\n\nMechanical control: Perennial Ragweed survives mowing, trampling, grazing and cultivation due to the longevity and dormancy of its seed. Plants may be slashed or mown prior to setting seed (i.e. at the early flowering stage or immediately prior to flowering). Checks should be carried out to ensure flowering is prevented in any re-growth that occurs. Regrowth may occur from soil seed banks and these plants must also be controlled, normally with herbicides.\nCaution If plants have set seed, mechanical methods may make infestation worse, spreading seeds. Always use property hygiene practices when operating in areas infested with Lacy Ragweed.\n\nCultural: Perennial Ragweed is not effectively controlled by cultivation. In fact, it usually makes the infestation worse by spreading pieces of the perennial root and stimulating development from root buds. Young plant that have not developed a root system could be hand pulled.\n\nFire: With heavy infestations, opportunistic burning can be a useful tool in controlling Annual Ragweed if paddocks have not been overgrazed. Burning needs to be done when adequate soil moisture will allow good grass cover to grow back.\n\nBiological control: The Ragweeds has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.

    "controlMethods": "When controlling Opuntia Prickly Pear species, an integrated weed management approach is usually desirable especially for larger infestations.\n\nChemical control: While several herbicides are recommended for managing Prickly Pears, chemical control is not always effective, as many species occur on rocky slopes, and infested areas must be checked and resprayed over several years if necessary (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Methods used are:\n\nFoliar spray covering all pads\nStem injection (includes drill and fill method on every 2-3 pads)\nBasal bark and cut stump (not normally used or considered best practice).\n\nHowever, plants are extremely hardy and follow up and monitoring may be required for 1-2 years to ensure plant do not re-sprout. Registered herbicides,  techniques and on-label instruction should always be followed in your state or territory. A variety of herbicides (chemicals) are know to be effective. Please see Sheehan & Potter (2017) for an overview. Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au. Permits from state or territory Environment Protection Authorities may be required if herbicides are to be sprayed on riverbanks.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical control either by manual (hand) or mechanical (machine) removal can be feasible and cost-effective for all species of Opuntia (Prickly Pears).\n\nManual (hand) removal appears to be one of the most effective control methods for for scattered and small infestations (Sheehan & Potter 2017). However, the spines make manual removal of these species difficult (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Using tools and avoiding spines and glochids is a top health and safety concern when working with Prickly Pears. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) must (should) be worn, and tools used that eliminate or significantly reducing handling of plants with spines and glochids used.\n\nMechanical (machine removal) is useful for large dense impenetrable stands (Sheehan & Potter 2017). This method is useful for removing bio-mass and increases accessibility for other follow-up control methods. Machine removal with front end loaders causes high levels of disturbance and will require planning and long term follow-up using an integrated weed management techniques for cacti and other weeds that could colonise the area. Normally mechanical control should be carried out when conditions are dry to avoid damaging soil reducing soil disturbance, reducing likely spread of plants. However caution should be employed as some species have glochids that are airborne and are more likely to dislodges and injure workers with PPE like masks or respirators worn with eye protection\n\nDisposal: Care must also be taken to remove and properly dispose of plants parts. Pads, flowers, fruits and even small sections of stems if left on the soil surface can produce roots and grow into a new plant. If one larges plant is uprooted, broken up, and left on the soil surface, each pad will take root and form a new plant. Where one plant was present there would now be many plants. The root system must also be dug out to prevent regrowth (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Plant can be buried at a depth of 1 metre on or off site. Burning plants (all vegetative, flowering and fruiting parts) with other dry materials for plants thahave dried out over summer can also be used to kill plants. However, you should consult you local fire service for advice and permissions.\n\nFire: The effect of fire on Prickly Pears are not well understood. For some species it has been shown that fire is not effective in killing all plants and they can recover with great vigour. In addition, fire and strong winds are thought to spread the stem segments of some species aiding spread (Sheehan & Potter 2017).\n\nBiological control: Biological control using Cactoblastis moths or Cochineal insects can be effective on dense populations, and outlying plants can be infected by transferring infected pads to them (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). However, there are a number of species of Cochineal insects that are host specific, and may destroy one species of Opuntia but not others (R. Chinnock, pers. comm.). The effect of these agents appears to be limited in colder climates (Muyt 2001).  Correct identification of Opuntia species is required so the host specific biological control can be used. Further information can be found in Sheehan & Potter (2017).",

Killing plants is quite easy but it can be hard to achieve long-term control of sea spurge because seeds can spread to new or previously controlled areas via the ocean. Success is more likely in areas where infestations are new and the chance of re-infestation from local and floating seeds is low (NSW DPI 2019).\n\nNon-chemical control: Small Sea Spurge infestations can be eradicated by physically removing the plants. Smaller plants can be hand-pulled easily, but large plants will need to be dug out. Protective clothing must be worn to protect skin and eyes from the toxic and highly irritative milky sap (Rudman 2003). Sea Spurge seedlings, which can occur in very large numbers, are best left to thin out naturally first and then pulled the following year prior to flowering. Follow-up will also be required to address subsequent seed germination or re-sprouting from broken taproots. Substantial declines in density of Sea Spurge can be achieved by this method, but it may take 4 to 5 years of concerted effort (Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania 2003).\n\nChemical control: Herbicide treatments can also be used, and may be more appropriate where disturbance from hand-pulling is unacceptable or where large infestations are involved (Rudman 2003). Spot spraying is suitable method for larger infestations, and a number of herbicides have been successfully used to control sea spurge, including glyphosate and metsulfuron-methyl.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nBiological control: CSIRO (2021) reported that the foliar blight fungal pathogen Venturia paralias (previously referred to as Passalora euphorbiae),  causes severe disease of sea spurge in its European native range. Preliminary tests showed that this fungus is potentially highly specific and has thus great potential for the biocontrol of sea spurge in Australia. Comprehensive host-specificity testing have been performed in an Australian quarantine facility to assess any risks that the fungus could pose to non-target plant species. Results indicated that the fungus does not pose a threat to non-target species, and thus approval for its release in Australia was sought from the relevant authorities. The biocontrol agent was approved for release in November 2020 and research is underway to develop effective methods for production and field releases.",
    "bestControlSeason": "Mass germination of seeds occurs in spring and summer and young plants form a taproot very quickly (Blood 2001). Flowering usually occurs from spring through to early winter (September to June), but is more dependent on growing conditions than on the time of year. The stems die off after flowering and are replaced by new shoots from the root crown. The long-lived seeds can float in sea-water for several years and more than 50% can remain viable after floating in sea water for 2 years (Heyligers 2002).",

Any material that is below the water line is not killed, and can regrow. Long-term experience with glyphosate has shown it is not an effective eradication tool. Some of the problems are that it is non-selective and also kills native species such as swamp grasses and sedges.

Mechanical control: Physical methods that include the use of heavy machinery combined with chemicals has been found to be effective. Infestations are sprayed with a herbicide to reduce the risk of spreading plant parts. Then 7-10 days later all silt and plant material up to a depth of 1 m is removed by heavy machinery.

See particularly Faithfull (1998) and DPIPWE (2019). If you have slender thistles, eradicate them before they set seed, as with all annual plants reproducing via seed.\n\nChemical control: Control via herbsides are used either via hand held applications or via boom spraying. Please see DPIPWE (2019b) for Slender Thistles (Carduus pycnocephalus or  the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au for control of thistles.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand remove isolated or small populations plants through spring and early summer.\n\nCultivation of the soil will encourage germination that can be followed up with herbicide application.\n\nPasture management: The best control is obtained by integrated pasture management to produce a vigorous and dense sward of pasture grasses during the main germination period in autumn to prevent successful rosette establishment. The traditional approach to pasture improvement of applying superphosphate tends to encourage slender thistles and worsens the infestation. In heavily infested arable areas growing a cereal crop for one or two consecutive seasons can reduce the thistle population provided a suitable spray program is used (TPIPWE 2019).\n\nGrubbing: where the number of plants involved is small, removal by grubbing is feasible. The thistle should be grubbed out (This method requires weeds to be dug out using a mattock or chip hoe) to a depth of at least 5 cm.\n\nSlashing: The Slashing or cutting will not generally kill Slender Thistles. However, cutting or slashing when the plants are in the late bud or early flower stage, in late spring to early summer, can prevent or reduce the production or spread of seed (TPIPWE 2019).\n\nGrazing management, Goats will graze Slender Thistles at the flowering stage, eating flowers, seed heads and stems. Over a period of several seasons this prevention of seed production can produce a significant reduction in thistle numbers (TDPI PWE 2019).\n\nBiological control: Slender Thistle has been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Use of rust fungi for biological control is currently being evaluated with the release of new rust strains to replace the ineffective strains that have been present in the country since the early twentieth century (TPIPWE 2019).",

Plants form rosettes which cease growth in winter but re-commence growth as the weather warms in spring with stems elongating and then flowering before the end of spring. Seed is shed from late spring to mid-summer. Plants die after seedshed. Note that elongation does not seem to depend on vernalization (exposure to cold temperatures) (Groves & Kay 1989; DPIPWE 2020).\n\nIn Tasmania further germination may also occur during spring, this being more common in the northern and north-western parts of the state. The autumn germinating plants form an over-wintering rosette and produce a flowering stem during late spring resulting in flowering and seed production in early summer with the life cycle usually completed in the midlands and southern part of the State before the end of the year. In the north-west the spring germinated plants continue through into summer and may even survive into autumn before seed shed and death of the plant (Groves & Kay 1989; DPIPWE 2020).",

Cleared areas should then be revegetated with native trees, shrubs and ground cover plants and repeatedly hand-weeded or otherwise maintained until the natural vegetation becomes established.\n\nManual control: Removing isolated Chinese Privet plants from natural bush should be done with minimal disturbance to the native vegetation, as Chinese Privet and other weeds are often better able to take advantage of disturbance. Younger plants can be hand-pulled, and uprooted plants should be placed upside-down with their roots in the air, to dry out.\n\nFire: Chinese Privet thickets do not usually carry fires and the plants regenerate rapidly by sprouting or suckering after fire.

Good hygiene practices such as cleaning of machinery and vehicles also aids in controlling spread (Mullen et al. 2005). Once established in dryland areas, innocent weed is very difficult to control because seed may remain viable in the burrs for at least five years. Some seed readily germinates after summer rains, but others in the same burr will remain dormant to germinate later, even skipping a year if there is a shortage of rain in late spring and summer (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nNon-chemical control: Preventing seeding is the key to successful control. This can be achieved by cultivation before seed formation, preferably at the seedling stage as larger plants are difficult to turn completely over. Repeated cultivation is necessary to kill subsequent seedlings. Heavy grazing by sheep also prevents seedlings but is not always practical. Well managed pastures can out-compete and exclude establishment of Spiny Burrgrass.\n\nChemical control: Application of herbicides to actively growing plants is effective (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Innocent weed can generally be controlled in most irrigated and horticultural crops to prevent contamination of produce, but due to several germination events in one season, repeat treatments may be needed during the growing season. Control of broad acre infestations by herbicide can be prohibitively expensive compared to the income produced from the land.

By 2001 the numbers were even further reduced (Groves et al. 2002). The many control methods for other Onopordum species can be used for Taurian Thistle.\n\nChemical control: Herbicide control of these three Onopordum species can be very effective and is an essential part of the overall management of these thistles and are used on large or dense infestations applying . However, plants can be tricky  to kill  because of the difficulty in wetting the woolly-hairy leaves of the plants. To achieve an effective kill the following should be considered; Timing of application is also important. If a single application of herbicide is undertaken then a springtime application is best (Dellow 1996), as herbicides are most effective on seedlings and young rosettes, Once plants begins stem elongation, herbicides may be less effective; The hairy leaves of the thistles can reduce herbicide effectiveness through reduced absorption. Therefore it is important to follow the herbicide label and use the recommended rate, application volume and adjuvant; Control will be reduced if plants are stressed. When there is a low density of thistles spot spraying  is preferred (DPI NSW 2019). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information available at http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  Because Taurian Thistle requires open space to establish and generally establishes in highly disturbed ecosystems reducing stock levels and allowing perennial grasses to establish is likely to drastically reduce the establishment of weed seedlings (Healy, Enloe & DiTomaso, 2005).  When there is a low density of thistles hand chipping is effective. Remove as much of the taproot as possible so that regrowth does not occur. Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Slashing or mowing is not usually effective as plants develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Plants can be mown or slashed before flowering to prevent seed set but this is temporary as plants will regrow and develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed and spread seed.\n\nCompetition and management: Pasture management is the most important part of any thistle control program is maintaining a dense, vigorous and competitive pasture. A vigorous perennial grass pasture provides competition for germinating thistles, reducing seedling establishment. Gaps in the pasture result in an increase in thistle germination and seedling survival so maintaining excellent ground cover at all times is desirable (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nWhile thistles respond to increases in soil fertility (and in particular nitrogen), management of all pasture types should aim to maintain pastures that have a good balance of perennial grass to legume content. Fertiliser application (as determined by a soil test) will improve the vigour of annual and perennial introduced grasses, increasing ground cover and reducing future thistle establishment.\n\nThistles are generally avoided by stock. However goats eat thistles at both the rosette and flowering stage as well as post-flowering and are known to be effective. This can be a vital step as it reduces seed production and thus limits recruitment of new thistle plants and also reduces the build up of seed in the soil. The soil seedbank is relatively long-lived.\n\nBiological control: Taurian Thistle has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Weevils were introduced to Australia to control this genus in 1992, but it was found that less than 20% of O. tauricum capitula were attacked (Briese, 2000). Taurian thistles are still capable of seed production under most herbivory pressure (Agriculture Victoria 2021).",
    "bestControlSeason": "There is very little information currently available on the life cycle of Taurian Thistle. It is a biennial herb, producing a rosette after germination (probably in autumn-winter-spring). This rosette enlarges in the first summer but does not elongate, flower and set seed until the second spring-summer. After seeding the plant dies (Groves et al. 2002; Healy, Enloe & DiTomaso 2005; Slee 2007, pers. comm.). Further study and observation is required to understand the life cycle of this species.",

Plants should not be under any moisture stress when sprayed. Surfactants (wetting agents that lower the surface tension of a liquid, allowing easier spreading) will improve penetration into the waxy-coated leaves (Miles undated).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for further chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Small infestations of Wandering Trad can be removed by hand or by raking and rolling up the stems (Muyt 2001). Very small infestations can be dug out, but every fragment of stem can potentially regrow and therefore needs to be removed and destroyed off-site but manual removal may cause disturbance to the soil profile and stimulate germination of other weed species. In sunny situations, covering the plant with plastic sheeting for six weeks in the warmer months will weaken the plant. After removing the plastic any regrowth can be dug or sprayed. This method will not work in full shade.\n\nResearch in New Zealand found that under their climatic conditions the most effective method for sustained control of Wandering Trad, without subsequent invasion of control areas by other weeds, was artificial shading. Efforts to control Wandering Trad by repeated herbicide application or hand weeding resulted in the regrowth of Wandering Trad and invasion by other weeds which hindered native forest regeneration (Standish 2002).\n\nAn infestation of Wandering Trad was successfully removed from a large garden in Sydney by intensive use of chickens. The chickens were confined to small areas of the garden beds until the plant was cleared above and below ground. Areas which were not to be cultivated were covered with plastic and mulched. The plastic was removed after six months (Pellow pers. comm. 2007).\n\nDo not dump, as this plant can re-root and establish after initial removal and can cause serious problems in natural areas.\n\nBiological control: A leaf fungus (Kordyana brasiliensis) that attacks leaves of Wandering trad is currently being researched by CSIRO has been trial released in places in Victoria.

    "controlMethods": "Arum Lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica) can be hard to control because of its large, hardy root system. Efforts should be repeated over several years to run down the plant’s root system. Successful weed control requires follow up after the initial efforts. This means looking for and killing regrowth or new seedlings. Using a combination of control methods is usually more successful (DPI NSW 2019).  Scattered plants of Arum Lily are best removed physically, but it is important to remove all roots and tubers. Larger infestations may be treated with chemically.\n\nChemical control: Larger infestations may be treated with herbicide chemically. Leaves and stem are shiny  Seed production can be prevented by spraying plants before fruits ripen (Weber 2003). Herbicides should be applied when the plants are growing actively, usually in August or September before flowering has finished (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Herbicide is effective when applied between June and September or October, but this can depend on the chemical and time of flowering. Follow-up application programs may be necessary after a year or two to treat regrowth and seedlings (Weber 2003; Lloyd & Dodd 2006; Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia).

Seedlings are relatively inconspicuous and make control difficult (Uren 2000). Mechanical control: Mechanical removal is only effective if all the root fragments are removed. Multiple rotary hoeing over a few years provides control.\n\nBiological control: including the use of potential invertebrate, nematode fungal (root rot), bacterial and viral pathogen and pest control agents, has also been investigated (Maxwell 1997; Moore 1997; Scott 1997b) overseas. In Australia control is limited to Chemical and manual control.\nFurther information on control of Arum Lily is provided by Armstrong (1997), Moore (1997), Moore & Hoskins (1997), Williams (1997) and Wykes (1997).",
    "bestControlSeason": "The seeds of Arum Lily germinate in late autumn to winter. Seedling growth is slow at first as the fleshy rootstock and rhizome take time to develop. Young plants continue to grow during summer if moisture is available but become dormant in early winter. New leaves appear in late winter or early spring. Seedling plants may not flower until the third or fourth year, while established plants with mature rhizomes flower at about the same time or soon after the new leaves appear (Moore 1997; Uren 2000; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nFlowering can be between June and February but is mainly from August to November. Some blooms may be found at most times of the year (Hussey et al. 1997).\n\nAfter flowering, the flower stems collapse and the developing seeds ripen as the spathe dries out. Top growth often dies off by late summer. The rhizomes continue developing until the plant becomes dormant in early winter (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlants grown from seed take several years to develop large rhizomes. In dense infestations there can be up to 100 t/ha of rhizomes (Moore 1997). The thick hardy rhizomes allow the plant to avoid unfavourable conditions of heat, cold, drought, and even chemical sprays by becoming dormant (Plummer 1997; Scott & Wykes 1997a).",

    "controlMethods": "White Weeping Broom (Retama raetam) is is not widespread in Australia and the preferred method of control has not yet been fully developed. However, experience in controlling other WoNS brooms including Cytisus scoparius, which is a major weed in southern Australia, could be applied to White Weeping Broom (Office of Environment and Heritage. 2014). Any control of White Weeping Broom should be undertaken cooperatively with your state or territory weed management agency or local council (CRC 2003). Once an area of White Weeping Broom has been treated, it will be necessary to monitor the treated area for many years and destroy new plants (CRC 2003; DPI NSW 2019).\n\nChemical control: No herbicides are registered for control of White Weeping Broom. In the case of Cytisus scoparius, chemical control is effective in the short term but is expensive and needs to be followed up for many years until the seedbank has been depleted. There is also a risk of damage to non-target species. Some useful herbicide control methods for the WoNS brooms can be seen in Office of Environment and Heritage (2014)  and DPI NSW (2019). Please follow your States or Territories guidelines, contacting relevant authorities if you are unclear, and follow herbicide label information before proceeding.  Herbicide application methods for other weedy brooms include:\n\nFoliar spraying: For the application of herbicide solution to weed foliage in the form of a spray, a common method used for woody plants. Foliar spraying can be used to treat plants of all ages but can be less effective on older plants.\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface killing the plant to prevent regeneration from the rootstock.\n\nBasal barking: This method involves applying herbicide mixed with an adjuant to the lower trunk or stem of woody plants up to around 50 mm in diameter to a height of 30-40 cm above ground level.\n\nStem injection (drill-and-fill): Stem injection delivers herbicide directly to the sapwood but is rarely used on brooms, but when used, it is for plants with stems over 50 mm in circumference.\n\nScrape-and-paint: This method involves scraping away a small section of the bark and applying herbicide directly onto the sapwood. It is an effective but rarely used technique normally used on larger plants.\n\nSplatter or gas gun:  splatter guns were developed over thirty five years ago for sheep drenching and has been adapted for weed spraying using chemicals.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical removal is an option for isolated plants, especially if they have not seeded; although seedlings are hard to hand pull, tools can be used making removal easier. However, it will be necessary to monitor the treated area for many years and destroy any new plants that germinate from the soil seed bank.\n\nMechanical control: Bulldozing infestations into heaps and burning the resulting weed mounds has been a common method used to control Broom but it only provides a temporary solution. Bulldozing causes massive soil disturbance, and physical movement of plants not only burying seeds but also spreading them beyond the original infestation.\n\nFire: Fire effectively kills plants and can help to break seed dormancy. Experience using fire to control other species of broom indicates that it kills a large proportion of seeds but lightly scorched plants may re-sprout.  Follow-up chemical treatment after fire will probably be needed for many years until the seed-bank is depleted. Usually though, fire is not recommended to control broom in Australia due to the risk of out-of-control fires and because it leaves the land initially unusable, with many burnt stems remaining in the ground (CRC 2003).",

Cultivated plants have been recorded as producing fruit within 5 years of planting (Johnson 2005).",

However, fire can create opportunities for land managers to prevent further spread and establishment.\n\nChemical control: After fire, Yellow Soldier's flowers are clearly visible, and the reduced cover of native vegetation makes the resprouting flowering bulbs easy targets for herbicide control.

      "Originally from Africa, Bridal Creeper (Asparagus asparagoides), a Weed of National Significance, is a long lived highly invasive scrambling herb / vine that is an environmental weed, destroying large areas of native vegetation in southern Australia.",
      "It is easily spread by birds who eat the fruits dispersing viable seeds in dropping up to several kilometres away from the parent plant.",
      "Forms dense impenetrable thickets smothers other plants, producing a profusion of below ground rhizomes and tubers which suppresses other ground flora and reduces available soil moisture and nutrients, excluding desirable species, also impacting native animals.",
      "The extensive root system and prolific seed production makes control difficult with herbicides and manual removal the most effective methods but they are costly and labour intensive and not feasible in many areas.",
      "Manual removal should remove all underground rhizome that are capable of producing new plants.",
      "Requires very long-term commitment over decades, with repeated control action and monitoring requiring an integrated management strategy.",
      "All control programs should aim to reduce the amount of seed produced, with prevention the most cost-effective form of weed control.",
      "Biological control is regarded as a preferred management option for many infestations of Bridal Creeper."

    "origin": "Bridal Creeper is native to Cape province, Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions of South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, KwaZulu-Natal, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Northern Provinces, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe (POWO 2020). As well as being naturalised in Australia it is also naturalised in southern Europe, New Zealand, western United States and the islands of the north Atlantic ocean collectively known as Macaronesia (USDA 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Control of Bridal Creeper (Asparagus asparagoides) is possible by chemical, mechanical means and biological control. However, when mature flowering plants and rhizomes (underground growing points) are removed seedling may germinate from the soil seed bank and follow-up is critical. Integrated control methods combining techniques, with long term follow-up is advised for success. Preventing spread to new areas by animals is difficult, so preventing seed set is important and the best form of control. When controlling Bridal Creeper (Asparagus asparagoides) the underground rhizome, need to be removed or comprehensively killed as re-growth can occur. Large plants with extensive root systems and underground rhizomes can and will survive herbicide application as some rhizomes are not  killed and follow-up may be required.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides have been the most effective method of control. However, because Bridal Creeper often grows in areas of native vegetation, it is particularly important to avoid contact with desirable plants or soil near tree root zones. Isolated plants can be treated with a recommended herbicide applied by spot spraying. As infestations become larger, a strategically staged approach for removal is advisable to ensure that treated areas are not re-infested (CRC 2003). In citrus and avocado orchards it is difficult to spray Bridal Creeper entwined in the leaves of trees. Pruning lower limbs to provide access underneath trees, a practice known as ‘skirting’, enables spot spraying with a recommended herbicide. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical removal is not effective unless all the rhizomes are dug up and destroyed. This may be possible for new, small infestations or as a follow-up after several years of herbicide control of a larger infestation. Slashing the stems and leaves may prevent fruit production and slowly deplete root reserves but it will not eradicate an infestation (CRC 2003). Small infestations can be controlled by hand pulling where practical.\n\nHand pulling can only be used for small plants and infestation. The rhizomes (main growing points at the top of the soil where the stem emerge) should be removed when hand pulling.  If the plant breaks leaving any or all the rhizome, plants will immediately regrow if conditions allow.\n\nMechanical control: However, for large dense infestations where little to no native plants remain, mechanical removal of above ground parts parts may help.\n\nCompetition and management: Grazing can provide some control of Bridal Creeper. Tamar Wallabies on Garden Island in Western Australia have successfully kept it at low levels there, and sheep grazing may be an option to control it under trees in remnant vegetation, woodlots and shelterbelts (CRC 2003).\n\nDisposal: When removing material off-site, rhizomes can regrow and re-shoot if not killed. Any rhizomes that come in to contact with the ground, on or off site, will re-shoot. Material can be composted or solarised and the same methods should be used for the fruits containing seeds, as these can germinate and grow in to new plants. If the plant is being removed from gardens, dispose of it through local government kerbside collection or tip facilities. Fruiting shoot material should be bagged immediately to avoid it being dropped or dispersed by birds. Root material (which can survive being dried for long periods) and seeds should not be composted or mulched (CRC 2003).\n\nFire: Fire can also be useful in reducing above ground biomass of larger infestations. In winter-rainfall areas, Bridal Creeper often emerges before the first autumn rains so herbicides may be applied before post-fire regeneration of native vegetation. As well as improving the effectiveness of herbicide application, fire may help to destroy Bridal Creeper seed and the dense tuber mat. However, use of fire requires permission from government authorities and its frequent use may endanger the survival of many native plant populations (CRC 2003).\n\nFires in late summer and early autumn can remove all under-storey vegetation and improve access for later spraying. If fire is used, regrowth should be treated carefully with herbicide to limit above-ground growth and further reduce the stored root reserves. Infestations should be monitored regularly and over several years because of the probability of regrowth from remnants of the root system. Regularly check for new incursions, carefully removing them or treating them with herbicide, as necessary. For new or small infestations hand digging of roots may be an appropriate follow-up technique (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Effective treatment of Bridal Creeper with herbicides or manual removal is expensive and labour intensive. These control methods are not feasible in many areas because of the size and inaccessibility of infestations. Biological control is viewed as a preferred management option for Bridal Creeper infestations of this type (Wills 1999). There are three biological control agents that have been released in Australia. However, it will take many years for the biological control agents to reduce the density of Bridal Creeper due to the huge reserves stored underground in tubers (CRC 2003). An effective biological control agent on Bridal Creeper is the rust (Puccinia myrsiphyllii), that attacks leaves and stems that can have a major impact on the levels of reserves in the tubers, but the rust is not effective on the Wester Cape Form. There is also a leafhopper, a sap sucking insect that feeds on the photosynthetic cells causing them to turn white, and a leaf beetle that feeds exclusivly on the young expanding new tissues of leaves and shoot tips therefore reducing biomass and fruit production.\n\nFor further information see the Asparagus Weeds Best Practice Management Manual (available at https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/-/media/OEH/Corporate-Site/Documents/Animals-and-plants/Pests-and-weeds/asparagus-weeds-management-manual-130486.pdf ).",
    "bestControlSeason": "Seeds germinate in autumn and winter in leaf litter and at soil depths of up to 100 mm. Buried seed that does not germinate rots within two years, while seeds on the soil surface may be viable for at least three years. Compared to many other weeds, Bridal Creeper has a short-lived seedbank (CRC 2003). Bridal Creeper plants take at least three years to reach flowering size, the flowers appearing along the length of the shoots in August and September (CRC 2003). Shoots of established Bridal Creeper typically emerge from the soil in autumn but earlier emergence can occur in years of high summer rainfall.\n\nThe green berries turn red in late spring to early summer (CRC 2003). There can be large differences in fruit production between years and sites. Early autumn rains allow a longer growing season, which favours high fruit production. The amount of fruit set is significantly greater where shoots are able to grow vertically by climbing up shrubs and trees, and less where the plants are heavily shaded, suffer water stress or where there is a high level of competition between shoots (i.e. older, dense infestations) (CRC 2003).\n\nShoots (above ground stems and leaves) may be present year round in warmer areas which normally have summer rains or are under irrigation. In cooler areas above ground growth dies back in late spring – early summer as temperatures rise and soils become dry, leaves turn yellow and fall and stems die back in (CRC 2003).",

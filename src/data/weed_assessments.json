The prevalence of Fleabane in fallows has meant a doubling in weed control costs in the last 10 years (Walker, 2004). It has also required a change from zero-til to cultivation (Loveday, 2004) and a change in farming configurations and rotations to maximise competition against fleabane (Walker et al, 2004).

Resistance in C. sumatrensis is still limited to paraquat (Storrie, 2007).

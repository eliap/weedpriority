Mature trees produce large quantities of fruit that are readily eaten by stock, feral pigs, wallabies and birds, thereby assisting the spread of the seed.",
    "controlMethods": "Physical and chemical control management are the only methods employed in Australia to control Chinese Apple.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control includes mechanical bulldozing of trees at least 25 cm below the soil surface. This will avoid resprouting. Damage to top parts of the plant usually ensures regrowth from lignotubers or cut roots (Land Protection 2007).\n\nDense infestations can be initially cleared by a combination of mechanical and chemical control (Land Protection 2007). Stick raking, ripping or using a cutter bar then treating the exposed stems with a basal bark spray is effective. Areas must be rechecked to control any regrowth. Fire: is not an effective control method (ISSG 2007; Land Protection 2007).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides have been found to be effective usually as a basal bark spray during times of active growth. Chemical application to cut stumps has also been effective at anytime of the year (ISSG 2007), but the herbicide must be applied within 15 seconds of the trunk being cut (Land Protection 2007). High volume spray mixture of herbicide and water to actively growing regrowth is also effective. Soil application of certain chemicals has been highly effective on dense infestations (ISSG 2007), but they do not work until sufficient rainfall moves the herbicide into the soil (Land Protection 2007).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

It tolerates a wide range of conditions including cold or heat, wind, fire, different soil types, moderate shade, moderate salinity and the effects of grazing (Weedbusters New Zealand 2004; Auckland Regional Council 2007).\n\nSouthern Wild Rice (Z. aquatica) grows in fresh or somewhat brackish marshes, swamps, tidal mud flats, streams, and lakes. Northern Wild Rice (Z. palustris) grows on muddy shores and in shallow water of lakes and streams, often forming extensive stands (Terrell 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Wild Rice (Zizania sp.) is a declared weed in Tasmania. It is not naturalised in Tasmania at present but assessment has shown that Manchurian Wild Rice (Z. latifolia) and its annual relatives may have weed potential in Tasmanian wetlands, lakes and river banks. Declaration therefore assists preventative management of this plant by prohibiting its trade and requiring eradication of all occurrences (Tasmania Department of Primary Industries and Water 2008).\n\nNative ecosystems: Z. latifolia, called Manchurian Wild Rice in New Zealand, is a serious weed of freshwater aquatic ecosystems in that country (New Zealand Plant Conservation Network 2005). Dense growth of Manchurian Wild Rice blocks waterways, impedes drainage causing flooding and disrupts recreational activities. It out-competes native water species destroying habitat for aquatic flora and fauna. It invades pasture, causing land to become waterlogged. The rhizomes penetrate and break up water banks (Auckland Regional Council 2007; Environment Walkato 2002–2007).\n\nZizania latifolia is also cultivated in Asia for its succulent stems and is available in parts of North America as an ornamental plant (Duke 1983; Terrell 2007). In North America, it is considered a serious threat to the native American Zizania species, as Z. latifolia is infected with the fungus Ustilago esculenta which causes swelling of the edible parts of the plant, the rhizomes and basal parts of the culms. The infection also prevents the plants from flowering and fruiting. If this fungus spread to the native species, it could have a devastating effect (Terrell 2007).\n\nNorthern Wild Rice (Z. palustris) is cultivated as a crop in some areas of the United States of America, with California being the largest producer (Terrell 2007).\n\nNorthern Wild Rice (Z. palustris) is grown as a gourmet food crop in New South Wales. Studies of this grain have shown that wild rice is rich in niacin, thiamine and riboflavin. It contains more high quality protein and lower fat content than wheat (Australian Speciality Rices undated).",
    "controlMethods": "Methods for control of Manchurian Wild Rice include digging out plants for very small sites and spraying with chemicals for larger infestations. Rhizomes persist for years and can recover after spraying, and the seed bank may re-infest bare areas, so ongoing control is important. Eradication requires 5–10 treatments over 6–8 years (Weedbusters New Zealand 2004).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "Manchurian Wild Rice (Z. latifolia) is a rhizomatous perennial, native to Asia, extending from north-east India and Russia through China and Myanmar to Korea and Japan. Southern Wild Rice and Northern Wild Rice, both annuals, are important constituents of aquatic plant communities in North America, providing food and shelter for numerous animal species. Southern Wild Rice is native from the central plains to the eastern seaboard of North America. Northern Wild Rice grows mostly to the north of Southern Wild Rice, but the two species overlap in the Great Lakes region, eastern Canada, and New England. Texas Wild Rice (Z. texana), a perennial, is listed federally as an endangered species in the United States of America. It grows only in the headwaters of the San Marcos River, in San Marcos, Texas (Terrell 2007).",

Also, Raupo leaves are thick and spongy, have no midrib, and twist upwards, whereas Manchurian Wild Rice leaves are dry and papery, usually upright and may bend at top without twisting. It also looks similar to New Zealand Flax (Phormium spp.), but Flax leaves are much wider, smoother, thicker and shinier than those of Wild Rice (Weedbusters New Zealand 2004; Auckland Regional Council 2007).",

Keighery (1997) describes in more detail the range of habitats and locations invaded by Arum Lily in Western Australia.\n\nArum Lily prefers subtropical to temperate climates but has a wide tolerance: tropical to cold areas, sun to shade conditions, frost to -10oC (if less than five days of frost per year), water-logging for short periods with up to 30 cm of water over the rootstock, wind, and salt (Blood 2001).

Following an assessment process, Arum Lily was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. It is a weed of agriculture, and is increasingly being recognised as a significant environmental weed, especially of damp and riparian areas, and of degraded seasonal wet natural  and urban areas, especially in peri-urban areas along creek lines, drains and seasonal damp areas. Found in gardens, sometimes originally planted. Dense infestations can completely eliminate pasture species or displace native species in bushland.  Infestations are generally confined to areas along rivers, creeks or swampy sites. Arum lily forms dense stands that may displace all species within the understorey layer. These infestations can block the flow of small streams, creaks and drains. Arum Lily is a problem for agriculture where it competes with pasture and is a health hazard for stock, being especially toxic to cattle. It is also poisonous to pets, and humans causing eczema and irritant dermatitis and is especially toxic to children causing fatalities.\n\nAgriculture: Arum Lily can form large spreading clumps. It is a problem for agriculture where it competes with pasture – dense infestations can completely replace pasture species (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) – and is a health hazard for stock, being especially toxic to cattle (Groves et al. 2005). The tuber-like roots and rhizomes, leaves, flowers (especially the yellow spike), fruit and seeds are poisonous, as well as being a skin and eye irritant to humans, livestock and pets (Shepherd 2004; Lloyd & Dodd 2006; Richardson et al. 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: However, it is increasingly being recognised as a significant environmental weed, which invades native vegetation and achieves dominance along watercourses and swampy habitats (Scott & Wykes 1997a). Dense clumps of Arum Lily crowd out native species affecting the biodiversity of natural areas, especially by replacing the native understorey. In wet, swampy habitats it can be extremely troublesome as it impedes water flow (Hussey et al. 1997).\n\nUrban areas: A weed in urban gardens, seasonal damp urban areas and abandoned sites, creek lines and drains, and disturbed areas such as roadsides.  The tuber-like roots and rhizomes, leaves, flowers (especially the yellow spike), fruit and seeds are poisonous, as well as being a skin and eye irritant to humans, livestock and pets (Shepherd 2004; Lloyd & Dodd 2006; Richardson et al. 2006).  Arum lily can also be toxic to dogs, cats and birds. If you think you have affected animals contact your vet. In humans causes eczema and irritant dermatitis (Shepherd 2004). The plant has caused fatalities in humans and stock and is especially toxic to children (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty & Associates 2003). Symptoms of poisoning include swelling and burning of the lips, mouth, throat and tongue, acute gastritis (stomach pain) and diarrhoea, causing exhaustion, shock and death (Lamp & Collet 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Shepherd 2004; Lloyd & Dodd 2006). Toxicity is due to calcium oxalate and the alkaloid coniine (Shepherd 2004).

    "controlMethods": "Arum Lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica) can be hard to control because of its large, hardy root system. Efforts should be repeated over several years to run down the plant’s root system. Successful weed control requires follow up after the initial efforts. This means looking for and killing regrowth or new seedlings. Using a combination of control methods is usually more successful (DPI NSW 2019).  Scattered plants of Arum Lily are best removed physically, but it is important to remove all roots and tubers. Larger infestations may be treated with chemically.\n\nChemical control: Larger infestations may be treated with herbicide chemically. Leaves and stem are shiny  Seed production can be prevented by spraying plants before fruits ripen (Weber 2003). Herbicides should be applied when the plants are growing actively, usually in August or September before flowering has finished (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Herbicide is effective when applied between June and September or October, but this can depend on the chemical and time of flowering. Follow-up application programs may be necessary after a year or two to treat regrowth and seedlings (Weber 2003; Lloyd & Dodd 2006; Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia).

Seedlings are relatively inconspicuous and make control difficult (Uren 2000). Mechanical control: Mechanical removal is only effective if all the root fragments are removed. Multiple rotary hoeing over a few years provides control.\n\nBiological control: including the use of potential invertebrate, nematode fungal (root rot), bacterial and viral pathogen and pest control agents, has also been investigated (Maxwell 1997; Moore 1997; Scott 1997b) overseas. In Australia control is limited to Chemical and manual control.\nFurther information on control of Arum Lily is provided by Armstrong (1997), Moore (1997), Moore & Hoskins (1997), Williams (1997) and Wykes (1997).",

    "similarSpecies": "'Arum Lily' is used loosely as the common name for both the true arum lilies (Arum species) and the calla lilies, Zantedeschia species (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Although commonly known as the Arum Lily or Calla Lily, it is not a lily at all but an Aroid (plants in the  family Araceae) with its brilliant white spathe (floral bract) surrounding the central pale yellow spadix (floral spike) bearing tiny flowers (POWO 2019).\n\nOne look-a-like is the he garden plant and escapee Arum italicum (Italian Arum or Aaron's Rod), from southern Europe. This  can be distinguished from Arum Lily by its smaller size, its whitish to yellowish leaf veins, a yellowish green hooded spathe (which is mainly white in Arum Lily) and orange-red to scarlet berries (Conn 1994; Shepherd 2004). There are several other species of Zantedeschia grown in home gardens, but these are not known to have escaped from cultivation (see Keighery 1997), apart from the widely sold, popular Zantedeschia aethiopica cultivar 'Green Goddess' that has been recorded from a few sites around the Adelaide HIls (AVH 2021).\n\nWhen not flowering, Arum Lily could be mistaken for similarly leaved plants such as the cultivated Elephant's Ear (Caladium bicolor) and Native Cunjevoi (Alocasia brisbanensis); Italian Arum or Aaron's Rod (Arum italicum); Taro (Colocasia esculenta);  Philodendron; and other pants in the Ariod (same) family as Zantedeschia.",

Following an assessment process, Noogoora Burr was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: The burrs of Noogoora Burr are an important cause of vegetable contamination of wool in wool growing areas, making fleeces harder to work with and reducing their value. Seedlings are poisonous to livestock, particularly horses and pigs. Some people may develop dermatitis after contact with the plant and the pollen may cause hay fever. An extensive root system and rapid growth rate makes Noogoora Burr a serious competitor for pastures and cropping (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems: Noogoora Burr has a strong preference for drainage lines and alluvial flats and also occurs on heavy clays of the ‘black soil plains’. It forms large dense thickets which can virtually exclude other understorey plants and thus is a threat to the biodiversity of wetland plants (Duguid et al. 2002).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Physical control: Hand hoeing or chipping is only economical for control of Noogoora Burr in small areas or sparsely populated situations. It is very labour intensive (NSW Agriculture 2004).\n\nGrazing of Noogoora Burr plants is an option, using sheep before flowering and after the cotyledon leaves have dried. A number of researchers and graziers have maintained that adult plants are not easily eaten by livestock, because of the roughness of the leaves and stems. Care needs to be taken with grazing to ensure there are no seedling plants, which could kill animals (NSW Agriculture 2004).\n\nChemical control: Both Noogoora and Californian burrs are susceptible to herbicides suited to a range of situations and regulations. Chemicals are most effective if the plants are young and actively growing. Plants under severe moisture or weather stress are difficult to kill (NSW Agriculture 2004). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nBiological control: A rust fungus, Puccinia xanthii, was first found in Australia near Brisbane in 1975 and then at Narrabri in 1978. Attack by P. xanthii has been shown to shorten the plant life cycle and reduce plant growth rate and productivity. Burr production was reduced by up to 59% but percentage seed germination remained unchanged.\n\nIn parts of New South Wales and Queensland, the rust can be effective in controlling both species, but timing and rate of spread depends on warm and humid conditions (NSW Agriculture 2004)\n\nNoogoora Burr has been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Since 1932 there have been four species introduced for controlling Noogoora Burr in Queensland, including Epiblema strenuana, a stem galling moth which was introduced into Australia in 1982 for the control of parthenium weed in Queensland and was found to be also affecting Noogoora Burr. In 1984 specific releases of the moth were made on Noogoora Burr in Queensland, where it has reduced the vigour of the plant.\n\nUnfortunately, these insects have had little or no effect in controlling Noogoora Burr within most of New South Wales because of the different variable climatic conditions of south-eastern Australia where Noogoora Burr is a problem (NSW Agriculture 2004).",

The Flora of Australia recognition of this group (unpublished) will treat these different forms of Noogoora Burr under one name, Xanthium strumarium.\n\nNoogoora Burr (Xanthium strumarium) may be confused with Bathurst Burr (Xanthium spinosum), another common weed throughout Australia. Both species have similar looking burrs covered with hooked spines. They can be easily separated as Bathurst Burr has three long sharp spines on the stem at the base of each leaf, while Noogoora Burr is spineless. Bathurst burr also has narrow adult leaves 8-22 mm wide and burrs with small or no beaks, while Noogoora Burr has broad adult leaves, usually 50-150 mm wide, and burrs with two distinct beaks (Navie 2004).",

It is a serious competitor with crops such as cotton, maize, peas, potatoes, soybeans, sorghum and grapes (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Bathurst Burr invades lowland grassland and grassy woodland, riparian vegetation, freshwater wetland, and rock outcrop vegetation (Carr et al. 1992).",

Following an assessment process, Bathurst Burr was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. It is a significant weed of agriculture and occurs in roadsides, water courses, waste areas, and rangelands\n\nAgriculture: Bathurst burr is mainly a pasture and rangeland weed, but also a weed of summer crops and horticultural crops. In the rangelands it is common in sandy creek lines and areas that flood. It is also found in summer growing crops such as soya bean and maize, and can be a significant weed of crops such as cotton, peas, potatoes, sugarcane and grapes. Burrs are an important cause of vegetable contamination of wool in wool growing areas, making fleeces harder to work with and reducing their value and causing problems for shearers. Seedlings are poisonous specially the cotyledons (seed leaves) to livestock, particularly horses and pigs, however older plants are not eaten. It is not such a major weed in the higher rainfall areas as it is a poor competitor, establishing mainly in bare disturbed sites, after floods or on fallows. It does not tolerate dense competition from other weeds or dense pasture. It has been widespread in the more marginal pasture areas for over a century (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Bathurst Burr also invades lowland grassland and grassy woodland, riparian vegetation, freshwater wetland, and rock outcrop vegetation (Carr et al. 1992). Dense populations could have a major impact on herbs and grasses in native vegetation (DPI 2007).\n\nUrban areas: Invades roadsides, watercourses and waste areas (DPIW 2007). Some people may develop dermatitis after contact with the plant (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",
    "controlMethods": "General management of Bathurst burr (Xanthium spinosum) is primarily targeted to prevent seed generation. An integrated approach to managing Bathurst Burr should therefore be implemented which eliminates existing plants by spraying or grubbing then establishing competitive pasture to help prevent new plants from establishing (DPIW 2007). Eradication of Bathurst Burr requires the prevention of seeding for at least four to six years and the elimination of sources of reinfestation (Faithfull 1998). Some seeds may remain viable for up to eight years (Anon. 2007).\n\nChemical control:  Bathurst Burr is susceptible to some herbicides, particularly on young plants. Bathurst burr is highly visible when growing, and control in pasture is readily achieved by commonly used selective herbicides, or spot spraying small infestations with non-selective herbicides (Government of South Australia 2021). Spraying should be carried out before the burrs have formed. Pasture improvement combined with herbicide treatment is the favoured method of control in grazing lands (Land Protection 2006). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Removal by hand is not recommended due to the sharp spines. Small infestations are best dealt with by hoeing or grubbing / chipping and is only economical for small areas, individual plants or isolated populations. It is also an effective follow up control method for plants not controlled by other methods to prevent seed set. Plants carrying burrs should never be dumped, as the seed may be easily spread but should be gathered and burned.\n\nMechanical control: Repeated cultivation of seedlings after each germination event is effective on arable land. Mechanical slashing should be undertaken before the burrs have formed (Faithfull 1998). Successive flushes of seedlings during the summer may require follow up control. Inter-row cultivation is commonly used in row cropping such as sorghum, corn and cotton to control seedlings that have germinated after irrigation events (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nCompetition and management: Strong competition, particularly from a well managed pasture containing legumes, will greatly inhibit the successful establishment of Bathurst Burr.  Adult plants are not easily eaten by livestock, due to the roughness of the leaves and stems and care needs to be taken when grazing to ensure there are no seedling plants, which are toxic to animals and could result in death (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nBiological control: An indigenous Australian Blight Fungus (Colletotrichum orbiculare) occurs on some infestations and is being developed by New South Wales Agriculture as a mycoherbicide. The accidentally introduced rust fungus (Puccinia xanthii) affects both Noogoora Burr and Bathurst Burr. The Bathurst Burr seed fly (Eurraresta bullans) was introduced from South America in the 1920s and affects large areas of burr in New South Wales and Queensland but provides no long term control (Faithfull 1998).",

    "habitat": "Species of Watsonia are typically found in moist situations in temperate and subtropical regions often on heavy soils. It usually starts as a weed of roadsides and neglected areas, then readily invades native vegetation particularly grasslands, grassy woodland and swampy areas (Faithfull 2000).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Watsonia was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Watsonia was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: Some species of Watsonia are suspected of being poisonous to livestock, but animals do not graze large plants and are apparently unaffected by consumption of young shoots. Selective grazing by stock results in desirable pasture species being replaced by Bulbil Watsonia with a consequent decrease in stocking capacity. Wild Watsonia impoverishes soil and crowds out desirable pasture plants. It can cause serious loss of production but rarely persists in well managed paddocks and cultivated areas and is of little importance as an agricultural weed. Only a weed in unimproved pastures especially those in high rainfall and waterlogged areas only encroaches into other pastures that have been un-grazed for extended periods\n\nNative ecosystems: It is more significant as an environmental weed, and can be an aggressive weed of native vegetation invading threatened native vegetation especially urban and peri-urban areas, in swamps, and along creek lines, forming dense colonies that exclude other plants (Faithfull 2000; APCCSA 2001). In native woodlands and along watercourses Watsonia can form continuous clonal stands that exclude other ground-layer species. Corms and cormels generally survive fire and prolific flowering and cormel or bulbil set can follow summer fire.\n\nUrban areas: Also invades roadsides, wasteland and unimproved pasture in high rainfall and waterlogged areas.",
    "controlMethods": "Watsonia can be controlled by physical means, and with herbicides. If controlling a populations along a water courses, start at the top of the water course as prologues (seeds, bulbils, corms and cormels) spread along water courses in the direction of water flow establishing on the side waterways.\n\nChemical control: Germinated corms and cormels can be controlled with herbicides. The herbicide glyphosate is generally recommended for the control of Watsonia. With correct use of herbicides at the right time of the year a 90% success rate can be expected (Day 1992; EWAN undated). Herbicides can be applied foliar spray or in sensitive native vegetation via spongy tongs (or similar tool) that coats both sides of the leaves with herbicide. See Herbiguide (2021) for strategies targeting the control of Watsonia species.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual removal can be a very effective way of controlling Watsonia when it occurs in isolated patches in bushland or other areas. The timing of hand removal work is particularly important in wetland situations as the soil needs to be wet enough to allow easy removal of the large clumps of corms and attached cormels, but not so wet that trampling and soil compaction are a problem. Observation of Watsonia growing on sandier soils indicate that the corms lie deeper and hand removal can be more difficult than on the heavier soils. The removal of flowering stems from all plants in a given population prevents bulbils or seed production and therefore recruitment of new Watsonia plants into a given area. Small infestations can be grubbed but corms  must be removed and burnt otherwise they will re shoot forming new plants.\n\nGrazing provides effective control on emerging and new growth only at the start of the growing season. Cultivation to 100 mm provides good control if done after the old corm is exhausted and before the new corms form or before the flower stem emerges. Dig up plants to determine their stage. A follow up cultivation is also needed. Mowing and slashing are ineffective unless repeated very regularly.  In pastures, establishment of suitable pasture species will prevent re-infestation from Watsonia species.",

    "similarSpecies": "No native plants can be easily mistaken for Watsonia, except perhaps the smaller and pale-flowered native Diplarrena. Many Watsonia species and their hybrids are cultivated in gardens in Australia, and some of these may be expected to naturalise.\n\nSeveral species of garden gladiolus are escaped weeds in southern Australia. Gladiolus differ from Watsonia in having three stigma-branches at the end of the style rather than six (Faithfull 2000).\n\nWhen the plants are vegetative they can easily be confused with other weedy Iridaceae weedy plants.  Foe a positive identification of Watsonia and the species and varieties flowers are required.",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Bulbil Watsonia is a major environmental weed invading woodlands, heathlands, seasonal wetlands and riparian vegetation. In south-west Australia Bulbil Watsonia is a major threat to remnant vegetation along the Darling Scarp and the threatened plant communities of seasonally inundated clay based wetlands. The production of very large numbers of stem bulbils has enabled it to become a very successful weed, forming dense stands that exclude other vegetation (Muyt 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Faithfull et al. 2007).\n\nAgriculture: The plant is suspected of being poisonous to livestock, but animals do not graze large plants and are apparently unaffected by consumption of young shoots. Bulbil Watsonia impoverishes soil and crowds out desirable pasture plants. It can cause serious loss of production but rarely persists in well-managed paddocks and cultivated areas and is of little importance as an agricultural weed. It can damage and impede the use of farm implements and the dead top-growth can create fire hazards (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Faithfull et al. 2007)",
    "controlMethods": "Where Bulbil Watsonia invades native plant communities it often co-occurs with a diverse range of native flora and so control options need to be relatively selective.\n\nChemical control: One method of selective control for Bulbil Watsonia invading bushland is the wiping of individual leaves with herbicide (Brown and Brook 2002). Although selective and reasonably effective it also is time consuming and sometimes impractical. Selected herbicides can be effective against Bulbil Watsonia without having an impact on co-occurring native species but timing is crucial. Herbicide application should take place when flowering stems are elongating and the parent corm is exhausted (see Moore & Fletcher 1994; Brown 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual control: Plants may be hand pulled to remove the corm in winter and spring when the ground is soft and wet. Plants that cannot be destroyed should have their stems removed before bulbils are dispersed. Hand removal however, is often impractical and the resulting soil disturbance can facilitate invasion of other weeds. Heavy infestations on agricultural land can be rotary hoed or ploughed deeply in late autumn and the corms raked from the surface and removed or burnt. The spread of Bulbil Watsonia can be controlled by grazing as livestock eat the young growth. Pigs eat the bulbils, and can be used in an eradication program (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Faithfull et al. 2007). Slashing at 100 mm or closer to the ground when stems emerge and well before flowering can reduce stem and bulbil formation and weaken the corm (Herbiguide 2021).",

    "impact": "Blue Periwinkle (Vinca major) is mainly an environmental weed in temperate southern Australia.\n\nAgriculture: Blue Periwinkle is a potential agricultural weed because it is poisonous to sheep, cattle and horses if eaten (Sustainable Gardening Australia undated). Anisworth (2004) did not consider Blue Periwinkle a problem in areas where sheep or cattle regularly grazed but observed that it is a common weed in horse paddocks. Although the leaves of Blue Periwinkle contain toxins, it was not a frequent cause of poisoning (Ainsworth 2004).\n\nNative ecosystems: Blue Periwinkle is a serious environmental weed in the temperate higher rainfall regions of southern Australia. It has escaped from cultivation and is invading native vegetation where it forms a dense mats covering and excluding other plants. It competes with native plants for moisture, light, nutrients. Its growth is particularly vigorous in riparian and moist habitats (CRC 2008).\n\nIn Victoria it is regarded as one of the top eight weeds of concern to public land managers (Williamson 1991 in Twyford & Baxter 1999). Blue Periwinkle is capable of forming a dense ground cover that suppresses native species and prevents tree and shrub regeneration (Thorp & Wilson 2008). Blue Periwinkle has also invaded temperate rainforest and identified as a threat to endangered and vulnerable plant species. A dense canopy of periwinkle can also alter fauna habit (CRC 2008). It has become a problem in various ecosystems, found primarily in damp and seasonally moist sites in forest, woodlands and heathlands, as well as along waterways and drainage lines (Muyt 2001). Blue periwinkle invades dry coastal vegetation, heathland and healthy woodland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, damp sclerophyll forest, riparian vegetation, and warm temperate rainforest (Carr et al 1992).\n\nUrban areas: Known as a weed in neglected and abandoned areas where its spreads vegetatively.",

The use of surfactants (wetting agents that lower the surface tension of a liquid, allowing easier spreading) in the spray also improves the herbicide effectiveness (Sustainable Gardening Australia undated). Plants can be slashed or mown and the regrowth treated with appropriate herbicides (Sustainable Gardening Australia undated). Follow up spot spraying of stem and root growth and seedling regeneration is best undertaken between 6 to 12 months after initial treatment (Twyford & Baxter 1999).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-Chemical control: Small infestations of Blue Periwinkle up to a few metres across can be dealt with by hand pulling,  grubbing or being dug out when the soil is moist. Care should be taken to remove the crown and all stems and roots to minimise regeneration. Material should also be disposed of carefully to prevent any spreading from crown or stem fragments (Harley undated). Larger patches should be removed in stages from the edges, folding the runners inwards towards the weed as work progresses. Cleared areas where the soil has been disturbed will be prone to invasion by Blue Periwinkle regrowth or other weeds CRC 2008). Another useful technique for small infestations is solarisation where plants are covered with plastic sheeting for up to 6 months, then regrowth treated with appropriate herbicides (Sustainable Gardening Australia undated).\n\nBiological control: No biological control options are available for Blue Periwinkle.",

    "habitat": "Great Mullein occurs in temperate, subtropical and some semi-arid regions, and often grows well in dry, disturbed and well drained or sandy sites of low fertility (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Navie 2004). It grows best in open habitats, and is shade intolerant (Victorian Resources Online 2007). It is typically a weed of unimproved pastures or sandy pastures and disturbed sites such as roadsides, old settlements, rocky outcrops, and waste areas (Navie 2004; Hussey et al. 1997), but also occurs in dry or stony creek beds and forest margins (Robbins et al. 1970; Navie 2004).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Great Mullein is capable of spreading very quickly and rosettes covering a large area.\n\nAgriculture: Great Mullein is generally not grazed and its survival is favoured by the removal of competitive species. It can therefore replace a considerable amount of pasture, potentially reducing carrying capacity (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Victorian Resources Online 2007). This plant is poisonous to stock, but the risk of this occurring is minimal as the animals do not tend to feed on it as the dense hairs on the plant irritate the skin and mouths of stock. Studies of Great Mullein have reported the production of anti-germination and root-growth inhibiting compounds that affect the seeds of Barley (Hordeum vulgare). This is not thought to be of any significance in Australia as Great Mullein is not a weed of cereal crops (Pardo et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Great Mullein can invade undisturbed ecosystems, generally open habitats such as grasslands, and therefore has the potential to displace native herb and grass species. High density populations have the potential to significantly alter plant community structure (Victoria Resources Online 2007). While not known to cause major problems of this sort in Australia, in other areas (e.g. North America) Great Mullein adapts easily to a wide variety of natural habitats, grows vigorously to out-compete native species, and can threaten the regeneration of degraded native areas (Remaley 1998; Starr et al. 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Great Mullein is easy to remove manually, especially the seedlings, by pulling or grubbing, and removing as much of the taproot as possible (Remaley 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Removal of plants by hand or garden implement should be conducted prior to flowering (Remaley 1998). As this species produces abundant seed, if flowering has occurred, care should be taken to remove, bag and dispose of all flowering structures (Remaley 1998). Care should also be taken with pulling, as the loosening of the soil can stimulate seed germination in this species (Remaley 1998). Larger patches may be cultivated, but subsequent pulling may be required to remove seedlings in following seasons (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can be useful if applied to the leaves at the rosette stage, before flowering when actively growing in autumn, winter and spring  (Remaley 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nBiological control: Great Mullein is not currently a Target for Biological Control in Australia. Two insect species, the European Curculionid Weevil (Gymnaetron tetrum) and the Mullein Moth (Cucullia verbasci) have been tested in the United States and have possible biological control implications for Great Mullein (Remaley 1998).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "similarSpecies": "Great Mullein (Verbascum thapsus) is similar to several other Verbascum species found in Australia including, Twiggy Mullein (V. virgatum), Moth Mullein (V. blattaria), and Cretan Mullein (V. creticum).\n\nGreat Mullein (V. thapsus) has grey-green stems and leaves that are densely covered with small, star-shaped hairs. The leaves are entire or finely toothed (crenulate). The flowering stem is robust and generally not branched. The flowers are densely packed along the flowering stem.\n\nTwiggy Mullein (V. virgatum) has darker stems and leaves that are sparsely covered in short, simple glandular hairs, not stellate (or star-shaped) as in Great Mullein). The leaves of this species are coarsely toothed (crenate), while those of Great Mullein are entire or finely toothed (crenulated). The flowering stems are sometimes branched, and are not as robust as those of Great Mullein. The flowers are loosely arranged and more widely spaced along the flowering stem, compared to those of Great Mullein, flowers are on shorter flower-stalks (i.e. pedicels) 1–2 mm long, and the immature fruit are sparsely covered in sticky (i.e. glandular) hairs.\n\nMoth Mullein (V. blattaria) has darker green and hairless (glabrous) or sparsely hairy stems and leaves. Its leaves are deeply toothed or lobed compared to those of Great Mullein, which are entire or finely toothed (crenulated). The flowers of Moth Mullein are loosely arranged along the stem and are borne on relatively long flower-stalks (10-25 mm), compared to those of Great Mullein (1–5 mm).\n\nCretan Mullein (V. creticum) has darker green and moderately hairy stems and leaves. Its leaves are somewhat wrinkled in appearance (rugulose) compared to those of Great Mullein. Cretan Mullein has only 4 stamens (male parts of the flower) per flower, compared to 5 in Great Mullein, and it has toothed bracts (modified leaves below the flower) and sepals, while those of Great Mullein are entire (not toothed) (Barker 1986; Navie 2004).",

It grows best around waterways and on seasonally inundated floodplains receiving 350-1500 mm of annual rainfall. Young plants may be found growing in areas of sufficient moisture such as around creeks, river levees, bores and dams. Once established they form dense, thorny thickets which become impenetrable to both man and animals. Its growth is also particularly suited to the heavy cracking clay soils of the Barkly Tablelands and is capable of rendering valuable perennial pastures significantly less productive (Gracie 1998; CRC 2003).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Prickly Acacia is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nAgriculture: Prickly Acacia could potentially infest vast tracts of grasslands and woodlands throughout Australia. The economic impacts of Prickly Acacia on Queensland’s grazing industry are estimated at $5 million per year. Even at medium densities, it halves the primary productivity of grasslands, interferes with stock mustering and restricts stock access to water. Control costs considerably outweigh its benefits as a shade tree and drought fodder (CRC 2003).\n\nNative ecosystems: Prickly Acacia dramatically alters the ecological balance of grasslands and thereby threatens biodiversity, particularly in the Mitchell Grass Downs in Queensland, home to 25 rare and threatened animal species and two endangered plant communities. Even a moderate canopy cover of Prickly Acacia reduces grass cover markedly and changes the relative abundance of native plant species in favour of forbs and annual grasses, in turn affecting the native fauna and overall ecology of the system. Infestations also have an impact on tourism and land use by indigenous people (Mackey 1998; CRC 2003).\n\nSee Victorian Resources Online (at http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/impact_prickly_acacia ) for a more detailed impact assessment.",
    "controlMethods": "Control of Prickly Acacia is possible by mechanical, chemical, ecological and biological means. It is recommended that the least affected areas of Prickly Acacia be controlled first to ensure the best value for money.\n\nChemical control: is most effective after the wet season when soil moisture is still high, and may be effected by basal bark spray (suitable for stems up to 100 mm in diameter, cut-stump technique or foliar (or overall), spraying (especially effective on seedlings and young plants up to 2 m tall as a follow-up to other forms of control)). Soil-applied herbicides placed as close to the trunk as possible can also be highly effective, especially when applied before rainfall (i.e. October-November for central Queensland).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical control should be conducted before the seed pods are dropped (the months before October to January), and will be particularly effective during drought because seedling regrowth is minimised. Large areas with a scattered to medium density of trees with trunk diameters less than 150 mm can be grubbed, cutting the root to at least 300 mm below the soil surface to prevent regeneration. Pushing and stickraking of Prickly Acacia are suited to large areas of medium-density infestation.\n\nChaining, or double-chain pulling, is especially useful for larger trees (greater than 40 mm trunk diameter) in established very dense stands of Prickly Acacia. Chaining is best suited to the second year of drought or before the first seed pod drop following drought. All forms of mechanical control will require follow-up to check for regrowth. Mechanical and chemical controls are both suitable as follow-ups.\n\nFire is effective against Prickly Acacia seedlings but mature trees are highly fire resistant.\n\nBiological control: Prickly Acacia has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Some native insect species that attack native acacias will also attack actively growing Prickly Acacia. One of these insects – the root eating Cicada Cicadema oldfieldi – is thought to be one of the causes of the Prickly Acacia dieback observed occasionally during drought conditions. A biological control program has been operating since 1980. Of 260 insect species known to attack Prickly Acacia, 17 are likely to only feed on Prickly Acacia and are therefore potentially suitable for introduction to Australia. So far, the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Water has released six insect species into Prickly Acacia infestations across the state. However, only a few of these species have established and their impacts have not been significant. Further research continues into the suitability and potential for success of other biocontrol species (CRC 2003).\n\nFor further information see the Prickly Acacia Best Practice Management Manual (available at https://www.weeds.org.au/WoNS/pricklyacacia).",

The seed pods are darker with much less constriction between the seeds. Needle Bush (Vachellia farnesiana) [as Acacia farnesiana] has small, scarcely constricted, cigar shaped pods and zig-zag stems. Mimosa (Mimosa pigra) is a small shrub with leaflets that are sensitive to touch and close when brushed. Prickly Acacia leaflets are not touch-sensitive (Gracie 1998).",

It is a known invader of established vegetation over a wide climatic range. It has a persistent seedbank and is fire resistant, fast growing and protected from browsing by its thorns. It is weedy in South Africa, where it grows in similar habitat and climate to that found in native grasslands from central New South Wales to southern Queensland.

Management such as removal of immature trees and regular burning may also prevent the formation of seedbanks in grasslands (Walter & Milton 2003). However, heavy defoliation and debarking by goats over one season did not kill mature Karroo Thorn (Scogings & Macanda 2005).\n\nChemical control: Basal bark, cut stump or stem injection methods can be used to apply herbicides.

    "origin": "In southern Africa Karroo Thorn is the most widespread Acacia. It is very adaptable, growing under many different soil, climate and altitude conditions. Its limiting factors appear to be intense cold and lack of moisture.

Plant densities of 1000–2000 trees/ha have been recorded. In Natal (with 750–900 mm annual rainfall) Karroo Thorn forms part of the coastal dune forest. It is common in the watercourses of the Karroo region of central Cape Province. It is also present in southern Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. In the early days of colonisation in southern Africa, Karroo Thorn was used for fuel, fodder and shade, and for the construction of wheels, poles and rural implements. The thorny branches were also used for protection against wild animals (CRC 2003).",

Common habitats are the margins of streams and lakes, floodplains, but also disturbed sites in rural and urban areas. Para Grass is a serious weed in sugarcane fields (Northern Territory Department of Land Resource Management undated; Smith 2002; Hannan-Jones & Csurhes 2012).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Outside of pastures, Para Grass invades native wetlands, river margins, and sugar cane plantations. It can have a profound impact on native ecosystems. In some places it can form pure stands, replacing native vegetation (Hannan-Jones & Csurhes 2012). Para Grass can change fuel characteristics in floodplains, when it replaces native grasses. More or more severe fires can in turn further displace native grasses such as Hymenachne acutigluma and damage or kill trees and thus reduce forest cover (Douglas and O’Connor 2004).\n\nWhen growing along streams, Para Grass can also slow down the water flow, leading to increased sedimentation (Bunn et al. 1998). Terrestrial invertebrates are reduced in abundance and diversity in Para Grass stands compared to stands of the native grass Hymenachne acutigluma (Douglas & O’Connor 2003a). Dense Para Grass stands can also have a detrimental effect on wetland bird populations, but does not appear to impact aquatic invertebrates (Douglas & O’Connor 2003b; G. Blackman, cited in Williams et al. 2005).",
    "controlMethods": "When controlling Para Grass populations, small and isolated stands should be controlled with higher priority than large infestations. Weed hygiene must be practised to avoid spreading Para Grass from the infested site to other areas.\n\nNon-chemical control: Large Para Grass stands are hard to eradicate, although intensive grazing leads to at least short-term decline in Para Grass cover (Williams et al. 2005). The same is true for grubbing by hand and slashing. Herbicides should best be applied when plants develop inflorescences. However, herbicides should not be used on plants growing over water (Queensland Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry 2013).\n\nChemical control: To remove dead material and promote fresh growth that is more susceptible to herbicides, slashing or burning can be performed some time prior to herbicide application. Optimum herbicide treatment time is from December to April (Northern Territory Department of Land Resource Management undated).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "habitat": "Gorse is found in heathlands, hillsides and embankments in temperate regions free from severe frosts, It usually grows where rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year and in the range 650-900 mm. However, it is very adaptable and dense infestations occur along Tasmania’s west coast where the mean annual rainfall is more than 2400 mm. The small dark green leaves are stiff and covered with a waxy coat, which helps reduce water loss. Together with its deep root system, this feature enables Gorse to flourish in areas with very low rainfall (CRC 2003). It grows very well on fertile soils as well as on light sands, heavy clays and disturbed and poor soils,  and on non-calcareous soils. In mainland states Gorse grows mainly along riverbanks, roadsides and other non-agricultural areas such as rail lines, quarries and mine sites (CRC 2003; DPI 2007).\n\nIt is an invasive weed of unimproved grazing land, neglected sites, roadsides and forest margins in higher rainfall areas. Gorse invades dry coastal vegetation, heathland and heathy woodland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest, damp sclerophyll forest, riparian vegetation, and rock outcrop vegetation (DPI 2007; CRC 2003).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Gorse (Ulex europaeus) is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. it is an invasive spiny shrub that forms dense impenetrable thickets (DPI NSW 2019)  excluding desirable species,  domestic & native animals, and people, and can provide cover for feral animals such as rabbits or foxes, altering fire regimes because of retention of dry branches and spiny leaves and the base of the plant..\n\nAgriculture: Gorse is a major agricultural weed in Tasmania and parts of Victoria and a weed in other areas of southern Australia. It reduces pasture carrying capacity and has rendered many hectares of land useless for grazing (DPIW 2002; CRC 2003), blocking access to land. It readily invades native, semi-improved, improved pastures, neglected cropping lands, and neglected hobby farms. Gorse also infests forestry areas, interfering with tree establishment, competes with tree seedlings, restricts operational access, imposes costs for control, and is also a fire hazard.\n\nNative ecosystems: Gorse is increasingly becoming a threat as an environmental weed in many national parks and other bushland areas. Gorse forms monocultures in native habitats, reducing diversity and impacting on native animals, and also alters fire regimes and intensity. Gorse readily establishes in riparian zones, wet and dry forest, healthy woodland, open grassy woodland to grasslands, heathland, and coastal vegetation.\n\nUrban areas: Invades roadside and railway reserves and spreads along these corridors replacing vegetation.",
    "controlMethods": "Control of Gorse is possible by chemical, mechanical, ecological and biological means. However, when mature flowering plants are removed, many seedlings will germinate from the soil seed bank and follow-up is critical. Integrated control methods combining techniques, with long term follow-up, is advised for success. Preventing spread in new areas is the best form of control and weed hygiene should always be employed. Where Gorse crosses property boundaries, any eradication efforts should be coordinated with neighbouring landholders to completely destroy all plants in the area and prevent re-infestation. Tackle the small, outlying infestations first. This allows a bigger area of land to be cleaned up first and there will be less follow-up maintenance in these areas as the seedbank will be smaller.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can be applied either directly to leaves when plants are at least 500 mm high or by cut-stump treatment (cut and swab; cut and paint or cut stump methods), where the plant is swan off just above ground level and herbicide is applied to freshly cut stump. Sprays should not be applied when plants are in full flower or when bees are active. A number of herbicides are available for use on Gorse (DPIW 2002; CRC 2003). Foliar sprays normally require complete coverage of actively growing plants, used with a wetting agent, and the plant must be allowed to die over a long period before being removed or burnt. Users of agricultural or veterinary chemical products must always read the label and any permit, before using the product, and strictly comply with the directions on the label and the conditions of any permit (DPI NSW 2019). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand pulling is only possible with small plants and seedlings, normally when the soil is damp and soft allowing easy removal. This is normally used after mature plants have been removed and results in subsequent germination of many seedlings. Mechanical control by clearing is a useful method of controlling large infestations of Gorse using bulldozers or tractors to rip and bulldoze the populations. Regular slashing or mowing is not effective in eradicating Gorse as plants will grow back vigorously once slashing stops (CRC 2003).\n\nCompetition and management: Grazing by sheep is moderately effective for controlling Gorse seedlings before spines are formed but high stocking rates are needed to force sheep to graze on Gorse rather than other pasture species. Grazing needs to be carefully managed to avoid overgrazing and subsequent pasture damage. Burning is often carried out in combination with grazing as it reduces the amount of leaves and stems and stimulates growth of soft green shoots, which are initially spineless and more palatable to stock (CRC 2003).\n\nCultivation: In agricultural situations where stands of gorse has been removed, cultivation with plough can disturb and kill underground roots and is useful for follow-up treatment for killing any regrowth and seedlings. However, some fragments may regrow. Cultivation in cropping is also effective at killing seedlings.\n\nMulching: Can be used to to suppress seedling germination but will not be effective for repressing or killing mature plants cut off at ground level.\n\nFire: Fire can also be useful in reducing dense thickets of Gorse to ground level to allow follow-up with animals or spraying of regrowth and to stimulate seed germination, allowing more seedlings to be sprayed the following year and reducing the seedbank (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Several biological control organisms have been released, including the Gorse Seed Weevil Exapion ulicis, Gorse spider mite Tetranychus lintearius, and Gorse Thrips Sericothrips staphylinus, all with some but limited success. Another thrip (same genus) of Portuguese origin is being reared for field release. A further two agents, a pod moth and soft shoot moth, are also under investigation for potential release into Australia (CRC 2003).\n\nFor further information see the Gorse National Best Practice Manual (available at: https://www.vicgorsetaskforce.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2-Gorse-National-Best-Practice-Manual.pdf )",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "As a natural part of Australian wetlands, stands of Cumbungi provide cover, food nesting places for water birds and other native animals as well as habitats for aquatic insects, native fishes, freshwater invertebrates (yabbies etc.) and frogs. The plant protects the sides of creeks, lakes and ponds from erosion. The prolific growth provides natural mulch for adjoining foreshores (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated). Indigenous Australians used Cumbungi as a source of fibre and young rhizomes were eaten (Briggs 1987).\n\nNative ecosystems: Cumbungi is a successful competitor in aquatic sites. Its tall, dense spring growth dominates the canopy during summer and early autumn and bulky rhizomes occupy most of the space available in the substrate (Finlayson et al. 1995). A study based on a series of aerial photographs of Lake Forrestdale just south of Perth illustrates how quickly Cumbungi can spread once established at a site. The photos revealed that prior to 1964, no T. orientalis occurred at the lake with the first stand appearing in 1967. By 1976, a fairly large stand had established on the southern end of the lake and by 1984 it had colonised almost the entire 6 km of lake margin. In the process, dense stands of T. orientalis had displaced the native sedges and rushes in the understorey of the Melaleuca woodland fringing the lake (Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nAgriculture: Cumbungi has become a problem in Australian irrigation areas. It can rapidly spread throughout a dam or irrigation channel, restricting the water flow, increasing the rate of siltation and by altering the water flow, increasing the risk of flooding and erosion (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated). The problem has become more serious since the advent of continuous rice cropping in the Ord River region, the Burdekin River, the Murrumbidgee, Coleambally and the Murray River Valleys (Finlayson et al. 1995). Over a period of time it can greatly decrease the amount of water being stored in farm dams and increase the amount of maintenance necessary (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated).\n\nUrban areas: Cumbungi has recently established itself along roadsides in table drains that do not have permanent water. This has led to an increase in the amount and cost of routine maintenance of these drains. Also, because of the large amounts of organic matter produced, Cumbungi can cause problems with water pollution when the leaves die off and start to decompose (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated).\n\nIn New Zealand, T. latifolia (Giant Reedmace) forms dense thickets, displacing native vegetation. It is thought that it could potentially hybridise with the native T. orientalis (Raupo) (Auckland Regional Council 2008).",
    "controlMethods": "As Cumbungi is part of the natural ecosystem and widely distributed throughout all states in Australia, aiming at total eradication is both ecologically undesirable and impractical. When planning control it is necessary to consider whether its presence in the area under consideration is a part of the natural ecosystem. However, if it is causing problems, it needs to be controlled.\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual control: Physical methods of controlling Cumbungi include grubbing out small plants, excavation of larger infestations followed by grubbing to remove all roots and rhizomes, cultivation for small infestations with low water levels and cutting below water level to starve the plants of oxygen (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated). Removing emerging flower spikes from established populations limits seed production and spread (Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nPrevention: Preventing establishment of seedlings is vital to limiting spread of Cumbungi. T. orientalis, an introduced species to Western Australia, has proven to be an aggressive coloniser of wetlands of the Swan Coastal Plain and Jarrah Forest. Trials at Lake Forrestdale found that cultivating seedling populations late in autumn, when most seed has germinated, effectively prevented seedling establishment. Although water levels are at their lowest at this time of year in Perth, the ground was still soft enough for this to be successful (Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nLand management: Maintaining a cover of native species in fringing vegetation will keep light levels down and prevent germination of seeds. Juncus species will displace seedlings (Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nFire: Case studies looking at control through low intensity burning of dense infestations of Typha species in North America, in late winter, have shown that under certain conditions, a 70% reduction in populations may be achieved (Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides registered for use in waterways may be applied in the period between male flowers opening and six weeks after female flowers open (usually December–February), avoiding run-off or spray drift entering the water. Using a wiper minimises the risk of run-off and spray drift and applies an even amount of chemical on the target plant (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated).",
    "origin": "Typha latifolia is a native of temperate Eurasia, North Africa and North America. T. domingensis is native to warm temperate and tropical regions worldwide, including all Australian states and territories (Briggs 1987). T. orientalis is native to tropical and subtropical Australasia and South-East Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, eastern Australia (Hussey et al. 1997), Norfolk Island and New Zealand (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Typha spp. are distinguished by differences in the female flower head. In T. latifolia, the floral bracts are absent, the stigma, the part of the flower that receives the pollen, is somewhat fleshy, the spike is blackish brown, rarely red-brown, 1.7–2.5 cm diameter and 10–20 cm long, and is adjoining, or to 0.5 cm away, from the male flower head.\n\nIn T. domingensis, the floral bracts are numerous and broadly spoon shaped, stigmas are not fleshy, the mature spike is cinnamon brown, 0.5–2 cm diameter and 12–40 cm long, and is separated from the male flower-head by 2–5.5 cm.\n\nThe floral bracts of T. orientalis are few or absent, stigmas are not fleshy, the spike is chestnut-brown, 1–3 cm diameter, and 8–30 cm long, and usually adjoining the male flower head or, at least, no more than 3.5 cm away (Briggs 1987; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nDespite their common names, it is difficult to separate T. domingensis and T. orientalis on the basis of leaf blade width. There is considerable overlap in this and other characters between the two species and expert help is sometimes required for identification (Brown & Brooks 2002).",

    "habitat": "Caltrop (Tribulus terrestris) occurs within crops and in orchards but mostly in open waste places, such as roadsides, overgrazed pastures, stock yards, roadsides and neglected areas particularly in districts with high summer temperatures and dry sandy soils where there is little competition (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Caltrop (Tribulus terrestris) impacts agriculture and people by growing over and out-competing other plants, and causing injury and damage to people and animals via the large numbers of spiny fruits (nutlets) that each plant produces. A single plant forms a mat-like cover over a relatively large area and may even discourage the growth of other plants through allelopathic (inhibitory) effects (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Spines of caltrop cause injury to fruit pickers, shearers and people around farm buildings, roadsides and recreational areas.\n\nAgriculture: It has become a weed of cultivated crops, orchards, over-grazed pastures, stock yards, roadsides and neglected areas, particularly in areas with high summer temperatures and dry sandy soils where there is little competition. The spiny fruits (nutlets) can injure animals feet of horses, sheep, cattle and dogs. Caltrop foliage is toxic to livestock, especially sheep. Grazing of Caltrop has been associated with nitrate poisoning, photo-sensitisation and sheep staggers (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Naughton & Bourke 2005).  If fruits are eaten by livestock it can damage the mouth and possibly the lining of the stomach and intestines. If they are growing in orchards, vineyards and market gardens they can both be an annoyance to pickers and can contaminate the harvest, particularly cereal or dried-fruit crops. Nutlets may also become embedded in sheep fleeces, lowering their value (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The plant can cause some agricultural loss and its presence may affect land value.\n\nNative ecosystems: Mostly grows in disturbed sites and open areas with little impact on intact native vegetation.  However, it can grow on the edge native vegetation, on the edge of tracks, sometimes in degraded grasslands and open vegetation, nature roadside verges and nature strips.\n\nUrban areas:  It occurs in railway yards, nature strips, parks, and waste areas towns and cities and grows in crack in pavers and car parks in urban areas. Prefers dry sandy soils where there is little competition and will from dense mono-cultures replacing most grasses or ground covers. The spiny fruits (nutlets) can injure people  easily penetrate human flesh, especially those with no shoe on.  Spiny fruits can pierce thin shoe soles, puncture bicycle tyres, and injure domestic animals, normally dogs. They are a particular nuisance to humans on playing fields and caravan parks.",
    "controlMethods": "Caltrop (Tribulus terrestris) produces large number of seeds per plant and their continuous germination (viability) over a number of years control of Caltrop may be difficult. The prime aim in control has to be reducing the number of seeds produced, reducing the number of seeds stored within the soil and stopping seed dispersal. Watch out for new outbreaks and weed out individual plants as they emerge. If coming from an infested area, be sure to remove any nutlets from footwear, tyres and clothing to prevent further spread (Naughton & Bourke 2005).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides are most effective at the seedling stage (Parson & Cuthbertson 2001). Application of a registered herbicide via foliar spry is effective. However, any fruits present may contain viable seed. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical removal: small seedlings can be hand-pulled and any fruit removed from larger plants  placed in a bag and disposed of in a bin or they could be dried and then burnt, if permitted by local council by-laws.\n\nMechanical control: Use a prickle roller, matting, foam rubber etc. to pick up mature fruits and dispose of them. Encouraging summer ground cover provides competition for seedlings\n\nGrazing: Caltrop is favoured by bare areas caused by overgrazing or drought.\n\nCultivation and management: Re-establish ground cover once control has been achieved. Pasture management or renovation to provide competition is often the key to caltrop control in pasture.  Mulching or maintaining a dense turf are the best options to prevent establishment.\n\nHygiene: prevention is the best form, of control. Make sure that any hay, produce, stock, soil and machinery brought onto any property is free of any nutlets.\n\nBiological control: Caltrop has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. There are a number of native species of Tribulus in Australia and so any potential biological control agents must be carefully tested (Barker 2007, pers. comm.). The larvae of a Native Moth (Ephysteris subdiminutella ferritincta) have been found to attack the seeds of Caltrop, but even though the level of infestation may be quite high, the overall impact of the insect is low. In California Caltrop is apparently controlled by the Stem Weevil (Microlarinus lypriformis) and seed weevil (M. lareynii), introduced from Italy as biocontrol agents in 1961 (Encycloweedia 2005; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "origin": "The native distribution of Caltrop (Tribulus terrestris) is obscure and the species is very much in need of a global revision. It is generally accepted that it is native to southern Europe and northern Africa but the plant is now so widely spread that this is not certain. It may have originated in the Saharan region, and spread into the Mediterranean region (Squires 1979, cited in Guertin, 2005). However only global DNA studies are likely to be able to suggest where it might have originally been native (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Caltrop (Tribulus terrestris) is a variable species in Australia and its relationships are in need of investigation. Fourteen other species are presently recognised within Australia and debate still occurs regarding if these are native or introduced. They are all superficially similar, Tribulus cistoides, T. eichlerianus, T. minutus, T. micrococcus and T. ranunculiflorus are clearly closely related.\n\nTribulus cistoides is a more robust version of T. terrestris, found in coastal areas of northern Australia. It has larger flowers (petals more than 15 mm long) and fruits which are more or less without hairs.\n\nTribulus minutes and T. micrococus are much less robust forms close to T. terrestris, but the nutlets either lack the pair of median spines or are less than 3 mm long.\n\nTribulus ranunculiflorus is a large-flowered form (petals 15-18 mm long) confined to the Kimberley region (Barker 1998; Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nTribulus eichlerianus is generally considered to be a native species and it is usually easily distinguished from T. terrestris because of its distinctively shaped and densely pubescent fruits. However as with the other species there is at least one undescribed form that appears as if it might be a hybrid between T. eichlerianus and T. terrestris. Similarly there is a form that appears as if it might be a cross between the native T. cistoides and T. terrestris (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nOnly further studies in the biology of these species, combined with a global review of the variation, is likely to resolve the difficulties encountered in distinguishing between these species. Until that is done there is no way of knowing whether there is any truth in the claims in the weed literature (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) that there are native forms of T. terrestris (Barker 1998; Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",

It prefers shaded moist situations, such as wet sclerophyll forest, rainforest, riparian vegetation and creek banks (Harden 2007).

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Wandering Trad out-competes native vegetation and smothers the ground by sending out roots at each node (leaf joint).\n\nNative ecosystems: Wandering Trad is a major weed in gardens and greenhouses. It forms dense mats up to 60 cm deep with stems up to 4 m long (Blood 2001). It also smothers native vegetation and prevents regeneration of all plants. It completely dominates the ground layer, preventing the germination of shrub and tree species (Muyt 2001). Research in New Zealand found that a dramatic decrease in species richness and abundance of native seedlings could be attributed to an increase in Wandering Trad biomass and a consequent decrease in light availability (Standish et al. 2001). The plant prevents regeneration of trees and shrubs, increases litter decomposition, altering nutrient cycling and inhibit germination of native species.  Can be found growing in the understory of disturbed forests, along roadsides, riparian areas and coastal forests. They are also common on old home sites and once established have the potential to grow forming a dense ground cover or “bed” in the understory (Brisbane City Council 2021).\n\nHuman and agriculture impacts: Wandering Trad causes allergic reactions on the skin of humans and especially dogs, and has been reported as toxic to cattle (Blood 2001). Mats growing on riverbanks can break away with water flow and contribute to flooding.",
    "controlMethods": "Chemical control: Spraying with selective or non-selective herbicides will work eventually, but repeat treatments of regrowth will be needed. Plants should not be under any moisture stress when sprayed. Surfactants (wetting agents that lower the surface tension of a liquid, allowing easier spreading) will improve penetration into the waxy-coated leaves (Miles undated).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for further chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Small infestations of Wandering Trad can be removed by hand or by raking and rolling up the stems (Muyt 2001). Very small infestations can be dug out, but every fragment of stem can potentially regrow and therefore needs to be removed and destroyed off-site but manual removal may cause disturbance to the soil profile and stimulate germination of other weed species. In sunny situations, covering the plant with plastic sheeting for six weeks in the warmer months will weaken the plant. After removing the plastic any regrowth can be dug or sprayed. This method will not work in full shade.\n\nResearch in New Zealand found that under their climatic conditions the most effective method for sustained control of Wandering Trad, without subsequent invasion of control areas by other weeds, was artificial shading. Efforts to control Wandering Trad by repeated herbicide application or hand weeding resulted in the regrowth of Wandering Trad and invasion by other weeds which hindered native forest regeneration (Standish 2002).\n\nAn infestation of Wandering Trad was successfully removed from a large garden in Sydney by intensive use of chickens. The chickens were confined to small areas of the garden beds until the plant was cleared above and below ground. Areas which were not to be cultivated were covered with plastic and mulched. The plastic was removed after six months (Pellow pers. comm. 2007).\n\nDo not dump, as this plant can re-root and establish after initial removal and can cause serious problems in natural areas.\n\nBiological control: A leaf fungus (Kordyana brasiliensis) that attacks leaves of Wandering trad is currently being researched by CSIRO has been trial released in places in Victoria. For information on biological control and this project, please see: CSIRO (2021): Australian Government Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (2018).",

    "impact": "Rhus (Toxicodendron succedaneum) sap causes severe dermatitis in humans and all parts of the plant are toxic (Parson & Cuthbertson 2001), and can invade some habitats in temperate and sub-tropical regions.\n\nNative ecosystems: A potential weed of disturbed sites, including forests, open woodlands, and urban bushland.\n\nUrban areas: Also a weed of roadsides, gardens and waste areas.\n\nHuman impacts: Severe painful allergic reactions can occur between 12 hours and 7 days after contact. These reactions include severe dermatitis that begins with a rash, redness, itching and blisters where skin has made contact with the tree. Localised swelling of the face, arms and legs is often associated with the rash. All of these symptoms usually last 7 to 10 days. However, chronic sufferers or more sensitive individuals may experience more extreme symptoms over a longer period of time. Contact with any part of the tree can cause these symptoms, but it is the sap that can cause the most severe reaction. Sensitivity to this plant can have an accumulative effect over a number of years, with initial exposure not necessarily causing a significant reaction. However, subsequent contact will result in stronger allergic reactions. Warning: For all eye exposures to sap, rinse the eye with water for 15 minutes and then seek urgent medical assistance (Queensland Government 2020).\n\nthe patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nthe patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification but do not touch the plant with bare skin.",
    "controlMethods": "Rhus (Toxicodendron succedaneum) management generally relates to either the removal of single ornamental trees, or the control of small outbreaks of seedlings or young trees in bushland areas. Mechanical removal of Rhus is the main method of control (Parson & Cuthbertson 2001). Care must be taken in all Rhus control situations as any contact with the tree is dangerous. Physical removal of trees has high associated risks of poisoning, and difficulties of disposing of the plant material. Wear protective clothing at all times. However a safe method of control is probably by stem injection of herbicide (see Chemical control below).\n\nChemical control: The safest method of control is probably by stem injection of herbicide (DPI, NSW 2019), also known as Cut stump. Other methods include the basal bark treatment and is suitable for trees or shrubs that are actively growing and not stressed. It is not suitable for plants with thick, papery bark, and involves painting the stems with herbicides. for further information see: Brisbane City Council (2020). Please also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control Preferably undertake removal in the winter months when the leaves have been shed to minimise toxicity then grub the trees, making sure most of the root system is removed so as to minimise suckering. Do not burn Rhus as the allergen is especially harmful as an airborne oil (Parson & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "similarSpecies": "The introduced Chinese Pistachio (Pistacia chinensis) is a similar tree but is distinguished from Rhus by having leaves which mostly lack a single terminal leaflet. The leaf underside of Chinese Pistachio is not greyish.\n\nThe native species Scentless Rosewood (Synoum glandulosum) and Ribbonwood (Euroschinus falcatus) have similar leaves and berry-like fruits. However, they do not change colour in autumn or lose their leaves in winter.\n\nNative Red Cedar (Toona ciliata) is deciduous and has compound leaves, but they usually have no terminal leaflet (except occasionally in young growth) and the leaf is larger (15-45cm long) with 8-20 leaflets.\n\nWhite Cedar (Melia azedarach) is a native tree which also retains its fruits on the tree through winter. The fruits are larger than those of Rhus (up to 2cm diameter) and are cream coloured. However, the leaves of white cedar are bipinnate, that is, at least some of the leaflets are themselves further divided into leaflets. The flowers are mauve, not creamy-white to yellowish-green, and produced in large showy clusters.\n\ntree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) has leaves with 5-20 pairs of leaflets and a single terminal leaflet (i.e. the leaves are imparipinnate). Its leaves turn yellow in colour before they are shed and its large (3-5 cm long) winged fruit (i.e. samara) turn reddish then eventually pale brown as they mature (DEEDI 2020).",

Although only in the early stages of establishment, these weeds have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems (CRC 2003).\n\nNative ecosystems: Laurel Clock Vine is a major threat to monsoon vine thickets and remnant tropical rainforests across northern Australia (CRC 2003). Its ability to climb to the top of tall trees as well as across the top of lower vegetation eventually smothers the species supporting them, often native vegetation, and may even lead to the toppling of mature trees because of the weight of the vine. It is particularly prevalent in areas on the edges of rainforest margins where light has been introduced (Navie 2004).",

However it is unlikely that one application will achieve complete eradication. Monitoring and follow-up will be needed. In Queensland contact your local government office for advice (Natural Resources and Water 2007; CRC 2003).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: The cutting of Laurel Clock Vines at ground level is usually not effective since plants will regenerate from their underground tubers.

They may be found growing together and in herbicide trials of 36 herbicides by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines there was only one herbicide which was effective against both species (CRC 2003).\n\nLaurel Clock Vine is unlikely to be confused with the other Thunbergia species in Australia as they have different coloured flowers. T. arnhemica and T. fragrans have white-flowers while T. alata has an orange flower with a black throat. In addition, none of these have the ability to climb in the same way as Laurel Clock Vine or Blue Trumpet Vine although they can form smothering populations at ground level (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",

For example, Shepherd's Purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) is an annual species that is almost hairless, its fruits are triangular or almost heart-shaped in outline. Hoary Cress (Lepidium draba) [as Cardaria draba] is a common perrenial weed that is densly covered in fine soft hairs, its fruits are shaped like upside down pears and are inflated (Navie 2004).",

    "habitat": "Grader Grass is a weed of roadsides, disturbed sites, waste areas, open woodlands, grasslands, pastures and crops that is mainly found in tropical and subtropical regions (Navie & Adkins 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Grader Grass was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Grader Grass was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: Younger plants are readily eaten by livestock, but flowering plants are unpalatable and rarely grazed. Because of its short period of usefulness, and propensity to out-compete more useful grasses, Grader Grass can seriously reduce the productivity of pastures in the tropical and semi-arid regions of northern Australia. It is also an important weed of crops in many parts of northern Australia, and is particularly troublesome in sugar cane (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is regarded as a major crop weed in coastal northern and central Queensland, and a minor crop weed in inland central Queensland and the Northern Territory (Wilson et al. 1995). Grader Grass is also a very common weed of roadsides, where it can quickly become a safety hazard by reducing visibility on corners (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Grader Grass can also significantly reduce the biodiversity of native grasslands, savanna woodlands and rangelands, particularly in areas that are overgrazed or disturbed (Smith 2002). It replaces native plants and forms tall thickets that can cover large tracts of land. Due to its greater biomass than the native plants it replaces, and hence its higher fuel loads, Grader Grass alters the fire regime. It does this by carrying more wildfires that are of a much greater intensity than the native plants are used to. Each of these hot fires, during the late dry season, cause a thinning of the native woodlands and eventually the number of trees in the ecosystem are reduced, resulting in a change from native savanna woodlands to exotic grasslands (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nFor these reasons Grader Grass is also seen as an important environmental weed in northern and eastern Australia. It is currently causing most concern in the semi-arid rangelands of northern Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it is abundant and continuing to spread. However, it also appears in the list of the top 200 most invasive plants of south-eastern Queensland, is in the New South Wales North Coast environmental weed list, and was recently listed as a priority environmental weed in two Natural Resource Management regions. It is also seen as a potentially significant threat to the Kimberley region in northern Western Australia, though it is not yet very widespread in this region (Batianoff & Butler 2002; Navie & Adkins 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Grader Grass should first and foremost be prevented from entering uninfested properties. If improved pastures are being sown, ensure that the pasture seed does not contain any Grader Grass seeds, as contaminated pasture seeds are the most common means of spread of this species to new areas. If Grader Grass is already present on your property, you should be careful not to spread it to clean areas on contaminated vehicles, machinery or livestock (Pitt 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nManual control: Small infestations should be hand-pulled or dug out and burnt on site, preferably before seeding. Alternately they can be controlled by spot spraying with a recommended herbicide. Larger infestations often require a combination of improved pasture management and, where the weed is growing above the pasture, the application of herbicides through a pressure rope-wick applicator. Care should be taken to avoid overgrazing, short slashing or burning of pastures and these actions will give Grader Grass an advantage over other species (Pitt 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nDense infestations of Grader Grass can be slashed prior to seed set; however, the plant has the ability to send up new seed-heads from slashed plants if conditions are favourable. In heavily infested areas, re-sowing the pasture is sometimes the best option. This should be done during the wet season, after the area has been cultivated at the end of the previous wet season, prior to the production of seed-heads (Pitt 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: In cropping areas, roadsides and nearby headlands should be kept free of Grader Grass to prevent it spreading into nearby crops. Within crops, Grader Grass can be controlled by inter-row cultivation or by application of an appropriate herbicide (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nCheck with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for the control of Grader Grass.

Its flower spikelets are larger (6–14 mm long) and are not very hairy. Native Oatgrass does grow to the same height, but is also longer-lived and has much larger hairy flower spikelets (13–30 mm long). Lesser Tanglegrass is short-lived like Grader Grass, but grows up to 3 m tall and has longer, softly hairy flower spikelets (6–11 mm long) (Navie & Adkins 2007).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Athel Pine (Tamarix aphylla) is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. It increases surface soil salinity changing ecosystems, shades and competes with desirable species.\n\nAgriculture: Athel Pine impacts the pastoral industry by increasing the difficulty of mustering, and decreasing pasture production. It contributes to the drying up of waterholes, thus reducing the number of watering points, increasing management pressures and reducing carrying capacity (ARMCANZ 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Athel Pine displaces Eucalyptus species and other native vegetation, resulting in dominance of the ground vegetation by relatively few species of introduced or salt-tolerant plants, and a reduction in the number of birds and reptiles (Fuller 1998) and invertebrates (Gouldthorpe 2008). The replacement of native vegetation with Athel Pine may also alter the fire regime as it does not burn well and hence suppresses the natural tendency of fire to provide a trigger for regeneration of native species. Athel Pine excretes salt through its leaves which leads to higher salinity levels in the dense compacted litter. It does not form nesting hollows so nesting sites are lost when Athel Pine displaces native vegetation (ARMCANZ 2001).\n\nAthel Pine is drought resistant and varies its water use dependent on availability. It is responsible for lowering water tables, and thus draining waterholes and depriving native flora of water (Fuller 1998). Dense Athel Pine infestations increases sedimentation rates by trapping and stabilising sediment during river flows. This can cause increased overland flooding and erosion (ARMCANZ 2001).\n\nAthel Pine also impacts the tourist industry by reducing the aesthetic value of rivers and creeks in Central Australia (ARMCANZ 2001).\n\nUrban areas: Accelerates rusting of roofs, gutters, fences water mains, building overhung by Athel Pine.",
    "controlMethods": "Athel Pine (Tamarix aphylla) can be controlled by chemical and physical methods. However, follow-up is always required to control re-growth from root-stocks. Germination by seeds may also occur. Preventing spread is the most cost effective form of weed control. Cleaning down machinery is useful as soil on machines  may contain seeds or root fragments that can re-sprout and grow in new areas.\n\nChemical control: Various herbicide are effective and available for uses Herbicide application methods are via\n\nStem injection (drill-and-fill): Herbicide can be injected into the bark of larger stems (Australian Weeds Committee 2011). Stem injection delivers herbicide directly to the sapwood. Stem injection should be no more than 100 mm apart as Athel Pine does not translocate herbicide laterally.\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface killing the plant to prevent regeneration from the rootstock. Cut stump application is suitable for large trees, but care must be taken to ensure that wounds are treated immediately and fallen trees are not left in moist soil where they may again take root.\n\nBasal barking: Herbicide can be applied to the bark of smaller stems. This method involves applying herbicide mixed with an adjuant to the lower trunk or stem of woody plants up to around 50 mm in diameter to a height of 30–40 cm above ground level. Juvenile trees can be controlled by basal bark application, but full coverage is essential for this method and difficult if surface sand is present. Seedlings and juvenile trees are effectively controlled by foliar application (ARMCANZ 2001) making sure that the plant gets a complete coverage of herbicide.\n\nFoliar spraying: Foliar herbicide spraying is the application of herbicide solution to weed foliage in the form of a spray, and normally is used for extensive seedling growth and limited regrowth from cleared trees and shrubs.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Non chemical control methods are usually followed up with chemical (herbicide) applications.\n\nPhysical control: Hand pulling can be useful for small infestations of seedling under 60 cm or where weed control requires sensitive avoiding native vegetation.\n\nMechanical control:  Machine control can be by bulldozing to remove individual trees or large populations. Care should be taken to remove all the root system and ensure that sand is not covering uprooted and felled stems as they may re-shoot. Chainsaws can be used to remove individual trees but herbicide must be applied at the same time (ARMCANZ 2001) with care being taken due to brittle branches.\n\nCultivation: or blade ploughing or the use of a cutter-bar is suited to large infestation of seedlings in wide, open, sandy creeks and rivers.\n\nFlooding: Can be used in areas regulated by waterways to kill plants by submerging and drowning, but thus method is slow acting and non-selective.\n\nBiological control: Although biological control is being investigated by the United States of America Department of Agriculture for other Tamarix species (ARMCANZ 2001) biological control is currently not available in Australia. The athel pine has not been endorsed as a candidate species for biocontrol research by the Environment and Invasives Committee (Hervey et al 2023).",
    "origin": "Athel Pine (Tamarix aphylla) is native to northern Africa, the Arabian peninsula, Iran and India (Fuller 1998).",
    "growthForm": "Tree",
    "similarSpecies": "Athel Pine (Tamarix aphylla) is very similar to other Tamarix species. Tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima) and Small Flower Tamarisk (Tamarix parviflora). Athel Pine is a medium sized evergreen tree up to 15 m that has tiny overlapping leaves that sheath the stem.\n\nTamarix ramosissima and Tamarix parviflora are large multi-trunked shrubs or small deciduous tree less than 5 m that have tiny stalkless leaves that differ significantly to Athel Pine (Navie 2004).\n\nAthel Pine has a similar appearance to Native She-oaks, Casuarina spp., and Allocasuarina spp. Athel Pine can be distinguished from these native plants by its fruit and close inspection of the scale leaves. Native She-oaks have scale leaves arranged in whorls around the branchlets. The scale leaves of Athel Pine are alternately arranged along the branchlets. Native She-oaks produce hard woody fruit that resemble small pine cones (CRC 2003; Navie 2004).",

    "impact": "Agriculture: Witchweeds, particularly Striga asiatica, are particularly problematic in South Africa and the United States of America. They can infest a wide range of grass crops including maize, millet, rice, sorghum, and sugarcane, as well as some broadleaf plant crops, e.g., sunflower and tomatoes (Smith 2002).\n\nWitchweed infestation can be a consequence of monocropping (growing the same crop year after year) with cereals causing declining soil fertility which can weaken the host plants resistance to parasitism. As a result of these cropping practices, Witchweed species have developed high numbers of long-lived seeds in the soil bank, with only some breaking dormancy each season (CIMMYT 2004).\n\nThe symptoms of parasitism by Witchweed species can be difficult to distinguish from those caused by drought, such as wilting, curling of leaves, stunted growth and a pronounced 'burnt' appearance to leaf edges. Witchweed infestations can significantly reduce yields (OISAT 2004).",
    "controlMethods": "Witchweeds can be particularly difficult to control given that much of their life cycle occurs underground. Mechanical or chemical control can only be conducted after emergence (Johnson 2003). Hand removal or hoeing before the Witchweed species starts to flower can reduce the seed production of the weed (OISAT 2004).\n\nNon-chemical control: Land management: An important preventative measure in agricultural situations is to avoiding using seed from harvests that have been contaminated (OISAT 2004). Crop rotation with 'trap crops' such as cotton, sunflower, linseed and Striga resistant maize varieties stimulate the germination of Witchweed seeds in the soil bank, which reduced the seed bank, without crop losses due to parasitism (Johnson 2003).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

The native species are difficult to distinguish from the exotic ones, and their identity should be determined by an expert (Barker 2008 pers. comm.; Navie 2004).\n\nAsiatic Witchweed is a small plant (15–30 cm high) with relatively small, narrow leaves (10–40 mm long and 1–4 mm wide) and small, often reddish flowers, 5–10 mm across. The flowers are loosely arranged in an elongated spike (Navie 2004).\n\nPurple Witchweed is a larger plant (30–100 cm high) with larger leaves (25–75 mm long and up to 20 mm wide), with relatively large, often pink to purplish flowers 10–20 mm across. The flowers are densely arranged on the spike (Navie 2004).\n\nCowpea Witchweed is a small plant (15–30 cm) with reduced scale like leaves (5–7 mm long), and small mauve to purple flowers 5–10 mm across.

It has a long history of being planted in moats, ponds and canals from where it has escaped to nearby natural waters (Cook & Urmi-König 1983), becoming a serious aquatic weed. It is a vigorous-growing plant that forms dense stands in suitable conditions making areas inaccessible. These dense stands can exclude native wetland plants and alter or destroy the habitat of fauna as well as choking waterways/waterbodies and interfering with waterflows, dams, navigation and recreational activities (Cook & Urmi-König 1983).\n\nIn Australia, Water Soldier has been declared in several states and features in weed and pest alerts because it has the potential to become a serious pest if it escapes from aquaria or outdoor ponds (Jordan 2007; Johnson undated). If introduced into the Australia environment, it has the potential to become a serious weed of freshwater lakes, ponds and dams (Jordan 2007; Johnson undated).\n\nWater Soldier is a very strong competitor for nutrients and it also has an allelopathic effect, i.e., it produces chemical compounds that are released into the environment and these inhibit phytoplankton (Mulderij et al. 2005, 2006).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Prevention: The best control is to prevent the introduction of Water Soldier into Australia. It should not be planted in aquaria or outdoor ponds. This is assisted by legislative control that declares its 'importation, possession and sale are prohibited' or warns 'do not introduce, keep or supply' this weed, and advises that, if found, plants 'should' or 'must be eradicated and prevented from spread' and 'land must be kept free of the plant'. As notifiable weeds in New South Wales and Queensland, all outbreaks must be reported to the appropriate state department.

However, they remain weeds of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: The Giant Rat's Tail grasses are serious weeds of pastures in the coastal districts of Queensland and northern New South Wales. They are of low palatability and can greatly reduce the productivity of agricultural land by completely displacing desirable pasture species. This reduction in productivity can be exhibited in reduced stocking capacities, longer periods of time to record adequate weight gains in beef cattle, and higher costs in milk production on dairy farms. For example, the cost of producing milk on two dairy properties in the Rosedale/Miriam Vale area in Queensland was increased by 15 to 25% by Giant Rat's Tail grass infestations. The economic costs incurred in managing these species with herbicides are also quite high, and heavily infested areas have reduced land values (Walton 2001). Mature leaf blades and stems are tough for animals to graze, and have been known to loosen the teeth of cattle and horses (Land Protection 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: The Giant Rat's Tail grasses are also significant environmental weeds in eastern Australia. They invade native grasslands, open woodlands, conservation reserves and wetland areas. When fully established in an area they can form a grass monoculture, excluding native plants and reducing biodiversity of native ground cover species. This can also have an impact on native herbivores, which find the plants unpalatable (Walton 2001).\n\nThe Giant Rat's Tail grasses are among the exotic perennial grass species invading native plant communities in New South Wales that have been listed as a \"key threatening process\". Together, they are also ranked among the top 25 environmental weeds in south-eastern Queensland (Batianoff & Butler 2002) and are also thought to pose a significant threat to rangeland biodiversity in central and northern Queensland. The Giant Rat's Tail grasses are already of concern in several conservation areas in Queensland and heavy infestations may also increase fire intensity in sensitive environmental areas (Walton 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Maintaining pastures in good condition reduces the chance of invasion and increases competition against Giant Rat's Tail grasses. Heavy grazing will not control Giant Rat's Tail grasses, and may actually favour their spread, so an appropriate grazing regime is important in any management strategy. Good hygiene and quarantine are also important to prevent the spread of seeds to uninfested areas. Moving stock from infested areas into clean areas is not recommended, unless they are spelled for at least five days in holding yards (Land Protection 2006).\n\nSmall infestations or isolated plants can be dug out or spot-sprayed with herbicide. Cut any seed-heads off and put them in a bag for destruction before digging out or spraying the plants, in order to prevent spreading the seed (Schulke & Elphinstone 2006).\n\nIn moderately to heavily infested areas you need to decide whether to keep the existing pasture and manage the Giant Rat's Tail grass population to reduce its effects, or to remove the existing pasture and replace it with more competitive and productive species. Replacing the existing pasture, by cultivating the soil and planting an appropriate sown pasture or crop, is a more intensive approach and is usually only practical in arable country (Schulke & Elphinstone 2006).\n\nWhere the existing pasture is to be kept, it should be managed is such a way to encourage a strong, competitive pasture understorey to replace the Giant Rat's Tail grass. This management strategy should involve appropriate levels of grazing, the selective application of herbicides, and possibly also burning to precondition the stand.\n\nChemical control: The use of a pressurised wick wiper to selectively apply herbicide to Giant Rat's Tail grass is probably the most useful tool in managing this species. It can be used to apply herbicides at a low rate to reduce seeding and improve grazing quality, and is relatively cost-effective. In certain large-scale situations, herbicides which are less active on native grasses can also be applied with a boom spray or by air, though this can be an expensive option (Schulke & Elphinstone 2006).\n\nTo get the most effective results with a pressurised wick wiper, a package of three treatments should be applied over an 18 month period. The first treatment should be applied in mid summer, when the Giant Rat's Tail grass is actively growing. Make sure there is a significant height difference between the Giant Rat's Tail grass and other pasture plants by allowing livestock to selectively graze down the good pasture plants. A second treatment should be applied in late summer or early autumn to prevent seeding, and a follow-up treatment should be applied the next summer (Land Protection 2006).\n\nCheck with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for the control of Giant Rat's Tail grass.\n\nAlso see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "The Giant Rat's Tail grasses originated in Africa. Sporobolus natalensis is native to central and southern Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Cameroon, Zambia, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa). Sporobolus pyramidalis has a somewhat wider natural distribution and is native to sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius and parts of the Arabian Peninsula (e.g., Yemen) (GRIN 2007a, 2007b).",
    "growthForm": "Grass",
    "similarSpecies": "Sporobolus pyramidalis can usually be distinguished from S. natalensis by its more open mature seed-heads, with stiffly spreading branches. Its flower spikelets also have smaller upper glumes.\n\nThe Giant Rat's Tail grasses are very similar to other introduced grasses including giant Parramatta grass (S. fertilis), Parramatta Grass (S. africanus) and American Rat's Tail Grass (S. jacquemontii). They are also very similar to some of the native rat's tail grasses, particularly the widespread and common Slender Rat's Tail Grasses (S. creber and S. elongatus). Distinguishing between these species is often very difficult and a specialist may need to be consulted.\n\nGiant Parramatta Grass (usually 80–160 cm tall) and Parramatta Grass (usually less than 50 cm tall) have spike-like seed-heads with numerous branches that are held close to the main stem. Giant Parramatta Grass seed-heads have relatively long branches (20–80 mm long), while Parramatta Grass much shorter branches (only 10–20 mm long). American Rat's Tail grass has more open seed-heads like the Giant Rat's Tail grasses, but it is smaller in stature (usually 50–75 cm tall) (Simon & Jacobs 1999; Navie 2004).\n\nThe Slender Rat's Tail grasses are moderately-sized plants (usually 50–100 cm tall) and are distinguished by their very narrow spike-like seed-heads. The seed-head branches are always held closely to the main stem, and are often widely spaced near the base of the seed-head (Simon & Jacobs 1999; Navie 2004).",

In Queensland it occurs as a weed of poor pastures and on roadsides and urban areas (Simon 2008 pers. comm.)",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: American Rat's Tail Grass does not present as serious a problem as Giant Rat's Tail Grass (Sporobolus pyramidalis and S. natalensis) in Australia, but its presence indicates depletion of pasture quality (Simon 2005). It invades pastures, replacing more productive types of grasses (Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries, Queensland (2007).\n\nOther species of Sporobolus grasses can quickly dominate a pasture, especially following overgrazing or soil disturbance. Mature leaf blades are tough and difficult for cattle to graze. Tough leaves and stems have been known to loosen teeth of cattle and horses whilst grazing. These grasses can also become a serious fire hazard (Land Protection 2007).",

American Rat's Tail Grass is therefore easily mistaken for a smaller, less robust specimen of Giant Rat's Tail Grass making it very difficult the separate them (Burkhill 1985).\n\nWeedy Sporobolus grasses are difficult to distinguish from other pasture grasses before maturity, however the leaves are noticeably tougher than any other species.

It is of low palatability and reduces the productivity of agricultural land by completely displacing desirable pasture species. The productivity and carrying capacity of invaded pastures can be significantly reduced, and farmers have reported losses in carrying capacity ranging from 10–80% depending on the density of the infestation. Cattle grazing in pastures infested with Giant Parramatta Grass also take significantly longer to reach equivalent weights to those grazing in uninfested pastures and the tough, fibrous nature of the stems can also increase teeth wear in livestock (Walton 2001; Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nThe economic costs incurred in managing this species are also quite high and heavily infested areas have reduced land values. Giant Parramatta Grass can have other less obvious impacts, such as causing damage to asphalt on roadsides and tracks and decreasing the aesthetic appeal of infested areas. Large infestations may also affect fire intensity and/or frequency, particularly in winter and spring (Walton 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Giant Parramatta Grass is also regarded as a significant environmental weed in New South Wales and Queensland.

    "habitat": "Parramatta Grass mostly grows in temperate areas with a moderate to high rainfall (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It favours sites with compacted soil, such as road verges and tracks, but will also invade pasture and sandy coastal sites, especially those sites receiving water run-off (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "A weed of lawns, footpaths, parks, roadsides, disturbed sites, waste areas, swamps, grasslands, open woodlands and pastures in temperate, sub-tropical and occasionally also tropical regions. It is particularly common in areas with compacted soils.\n\nAgriculture: Parramatta Grass has very low feed value, and being very tough, mature leaf blades are tough and difficult for cattle to graze and can loosen the teeth of stock feeding on it. (Queensland Government 2016). It invades pastures and replaces (out-competes) productive grasses and is known to dominate in wet, swampy areas (Department of Primary Industry & Fisheries, Queensland 2007) and replaces more productive types of grass, especially after overgrazing or soil disturbance and causes loss in carrying capacity and decreased production by up to 80% (Queensland Government 2016).\n\nNative ecosystems: reported as a weed of some open degraded natural environments and known to dominate in wet, swampy areas and displace other native grass species.\n\nUrban environments: It causes structural problems when growing on road verges where it can break through asphalt (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Parramatta Grass can be controlled by hand pulling small plants (bagging the seed head first to prevent seed dispersal), and slashing larger plants before spraying with herbicide (Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nChemical control: Numerous herbicides are effective if applied at the active growing phase.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nThe Sporobolus best practice manual, which includes principles of management and control as they apply to weedy Sporobolus grasses is available at https://futurebeef.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Weedy_sporobolus_manual.pdf",

    "similarSpecies": "Giant Parramatta Grass (Sporobolus fertilis) is a very similar, but larger, version of Parramatta Grass, reaching 1.6 m high, with a seed head up to 45 cm long. Its lower branches are much longer (8–11 cm) than those of Parramatta Grass and may hang away from the stem at maturity and they grow in similar areas. It is a common pasture weed on the New South Wales north coast, where it is particularly invasive in wet areas.\n\nTwo native rat's tail grasses (S. elongatus and S. creber) are also common in eastern Australia. They have more interrupted seed heads than Parramatta Grass with the stem visible between the branches, at least in the lower part of the head. The length of the lower branches in these two species is only 5 cm or less. Distinguishing between native and introduced Sporobolus species can be difficult and expert assistance may be needed.",

It has invaded both dry and moist habitats, and a range of soil types, including sandy, granitic, loamy and red-yellow clay soil (Queensland Herbarium 2007). On Christmas Island Pacific False Buttonweed occurs along shaded tracks in tall rainforest (Du Puy 1993).",

In Australia, although it invades tracks in primary rainforest, rice, banana, sugarcane, and pinto peanut plantations, as well as gardens, lawns and roadsides (Du Puy 1993; Northern Territory Government 2006; Queensland Herbarium 2007), there is virtually no information about the level of impact that it may have.\n\nThe government of Northern Territory, where Pacific False Buttonweed has not as yet been recorded as naturalised (Kerrigan & Albrecht 2007), perceives the species as posing a significant threat, and as such it has been declared as a noxious weed (Northern Territory Government 2007).",

    "similarSpecies": "Worldwide there are approximately 275 species of Spermacoce, with approximately 90 species in Australia.\n\nGenerally, Pacific False Buttonweed can be distinguished from other species of Spermacoce in Australia by the fact that the flower clusters are found in the forks of the leaves and there are 2 calyx lobes (outermost 'petals' of the flowers), with most species in Australia having a 4-lobed calyx. There is one species Spermacoce verticillata, which also has a 2-lobed calyx and is hard to distinguish from Pacific False Button weed (Taylor & Steyermark 2004; Harwood & Dessein 2005). For further identification assistance should be sought from the Herbarium in your state or territory.\n\nThe Pacific False Buttonweed also closely resembles Spermacoce ocymoides however this species does not occur in Australia (Ridsdale 1998).",

    "habitat": "Spanish Broom is usually found close to towns and urban areas, and in agricultural areas near old farmhouses. It is typically a weed of disturbed sites such as roadsides and railway lines, as well as disturbed urban bushland, streams, and roadside drains (AVH 2020).\n\nIt has been collected from various soil types: in Queensland it has been recorded as growing on red soil at Toowoomba in south-eastern Queensland, growing on sandy soil in the Darling Downs and growing on black clay at Inverell in New South Wales. It has been collected from dry, low rainfall regions such as from roadside mallee scrub on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, to cooler, more elevated and mesic (moist) sites at Inverell, where it has naturalised along the MacIntyre River (AVH 2020).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Spanish Broom (Spartium junceum) is commonly grown as a garden ornamental, particularly in the cooler parts of Australia. It has escaped cultivation and is regarded as a minor environmental weed. Spanish Broom is able to fix nitrogen and can increase the nitrogen content of the soil at the sites where it invades and facilitate the invasion of other weeds (Zouhar 2005; Southern Tablelands and South Coast Noxious Plants Committee undated). Broom species primarily threaten natural habitats such as conservation areas at present, although they may also compete with favourable species in pastures. Spanish broom can dominate disturbed areas where it can out-compete native plants and alter soil nutrients (DPI NSW 2019)\n\nAgriculture: To date, limited impact in primary production areas, with potential to invade poorly managed pastures and hobby farms if left unchecked.\n\nNative ecosystems: Native flora and fauna are threatened when native plants are out-competed and natural habitat is replaced by infestations of Broom species. Broom species may also harbour rabbits. These weed species are able to invade seemingly undisturbed bushland and therefore represent a significant threat to ecological values (Regional Weeds Advisory Committee 2002; Southern Tablelands and South Coast Noxious Plants Committee undated). In Victoria, Spanish Broom invades lowland grassland, grassy woodland and rock outcrop vegetation, and it is listed as being a 'potential threat to one or more vegetation formations' (Carr et al. 1992). Although currently Spanish Broom is relatively sparingly naturalised in Australia, there is potential for the species to become a more serious weed in the future, as it has in California (Zouhar 2005).\n\nUrban areas: Occasionally persistent and  spreads in abandoned gardens in to roadside, and little managed urban areas. The seeds and leaves of Spanish Broom, if eaten in large quantities, are very poisonous, especially to children. They contain the toxin quinolizidine alkaloid cytosine and sparteine (Shepherd 2004). Spanish broom is toxic to humans a but is not considered life-threatening. Symptoms when ingested include, causing nausea, diarrhea, convulsions and respiratory distress.\n\nWhat to do if poisoning occurs:\n\nIf the patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nIf the patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",
    "controlMethods": "Allegedly sterile hybrid forms of Spanish Broom (Spartium junceum) are still sold in nurseries. These have been observed to produce seed and revert to the wild type, and should not be planted (Southern Tablelands and South Coast Noxious Plants Committee undated).  The same or similar control methods can be applied to Spanish broom (Spartium junceum), that are applied to other WoNS brooms including Cytisus scoparius, which is a major weed in southern Australia (Office of Environment and Heritage. 2014). Although not as invasive as other Broom species, follow-up monitoring and removal of seedling is required when undertaking control of Spanish Broom. Seedlings can be sprayed or hand pulled. Prolific seed production and long viability results in a large soil seed bank which will continue to germinate for many years after mature plants are removed.\n\nChemical control: With large infestations, the most effective control will probably be achieved by applying herbicides, as part of an integrated management plan, to gain initial reduction of the weeds as a first step. It is best to apply the herbicides when the plants are in full leaf (Zouhar 2005). For control of Spanish Broom, methods applied to Cytisus scoparius, should be effective, but follow-up is required until the seedbank has been depleted. Some useful herbicide control methods for the WoNS brooms can be seen in Office of Environment and Heritage (2014) and DPI NSW (2019). Please follow your States or Territories guidelines, contacting relevant authorities if you are unclear, and follow herbicide label information before proceeding.  Herbicide application methods for other weedy brooms include:\n\nFoliar spraying: For the application of herbicide solution to weed foliage in the form of a spray, a common method used for woody plants. Foliar spraying can be used to treat plants of all ages but can be less effective on older plants.\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface killing the plant to prevent regeneration from the rootstock. This is useful for large plants, that are cut and painted with herbicide to prevent re-sprouting.\n\nBasal barking: This method involves applying herbicide mixed with an adjuant to the lower trunk or stem of woody plants up to around 50 mm in diameter to a height of 30-40 cm above ground level.\n\nStem injection (drill-and-fill): Stem injection delivers herbicide directly to the sapwood but is rarely used on brooms, but when used, it is for plants with stems over 50 mm in circumference.\n\nScrape-and-paint: This method involves scraping away a small section of the bark and applying herbicide directly onto the sapwood. It is an effective but rarely used technique normally used on larger plants.\n\nSplatter or gas gun:  splatter guns were developed over thirty five years ago for sheep drenching and has been adapted for weed spraying using chemicals.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical removal is an option for isolated plants, especially if they have not seeded; although seedlings are hard to hand pull, tools can be used making removal easier. However, it will be necessary to monitor the treated area for many years and destroy any new plants that germinate from the soil seed bank.\n\nMechanical control: Bulldozing infestations into heaps and burning the resulting weed mounds has been a common method used to control Broom but it only provides a temporary solution. Bulldozing causes massive soil disturbance, and physical movement of plants not only burying seeds but also spreading them beyond the original infestation.\n\nCultural: Infestations of young plants can also be grazed to prevent the plants maturing, flowering and setting seed. However, grazing needs to be continued until the soil stored seed bank is exhausted (Hoshovsky 2001).\n\nFire: Fire effectively kills plants and can help to break seed dormancy. Fire may be helpful in encouraging most seed to germinate and produce seedlings that can then be sprayed. However, fire without follow up treatment is only likely to make the situation worse (Southern Tablelands and South Coast Noxious Plants Committee undated).  Experience using fire to control other species of broom indicates that it kills a large proportion of seeds but lightly scorched plants may re-sprout.  Follow-up chemical treatment after fire will probably be needed until the seed-bank is depleted.",

    "growthForm": "Shrub",
    "similarSpecies": "Spanish Broom may be confused with a number of other introduced Broom species.\n\nEnglish (or Scotch) Broom (Cytisus scoparius) is perhaps the species most likely to cause confusion in the identification process. However, the branchlets of English Broom are characteristically prominently five-angled in cross-section where the branchlets of Spanish Broom are rounded in cross-section, with many fine lengthwise ribs. The leaves of English Broom are composed of three leaflets, while those of Spanish Broom are not divided into leaflets (Heywood 1968; Webb 1988).\n\nThere are a number of native shrubs in the pea family which may potentially be confused with Spanish Broom. Dogwood (Jacksonia scoparia) has furrowed black bark, strongly angled or winged branchlets, and is often weeping in habit. Its flowers are smaller than Spanish Broom's and are cream or orange-yellow, and the pods are tiny (Wiecek & Williams 2002).\n\nThe Native Broom (Viminaria juncea) is an upright shrub with pendulous branches, with the young leaves having 1-3 leaflets. The corolla (collective term for petals) is 7-10 mm long, yellow to orange and often has red blotches. The pods are small, 4-5 mm long. It grows in swampy habitats near the coast (Wiecek 2002).",

    "impact": "Common Cord-grass was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Common Cord-grass was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nNative ecosystems: Common Cord-grass invasion has resulted in the alteration of coastal environments – transforming saltmarsh and mangrove communities and sandy beaches into 'Spartina meadows' (Muyt 2001; Walsh 2007, pers. comm.). The effects on biota in these habitats is largely unknown in Australia, but there is evidence that wader-bird use of areas previously free of Common Cord-grass declines significantly following invasion by the grass (Simpson 1996).\n\nBased largely on non-Australian studies, one effect is believed to be as a direct consequence of change of structure of the community, from a low-open herbland/shrubland, to relatively tall, dense grassland. The availability of food species such as small crustaceans and molluscs is almost certainly affected too, further rendering habitats unsuitable for fauna that depend on these (Lee & Choy 2004).\n\nHuman impacts: Social impacts include rendering boating and boat launching facilities inoperable due to accretion of sediments by Common Cord-grass plants (Walsh 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nAgriculture: Common Cord-grass infestations can also affect oyster farming in the intertidal areas and change hydrodynamics (Kriwoken & Hedge 2000).",
    "controlMethods": "A number of control techniques have been trialled for Common Cord-grass in Australia, most actively in Tasmania, but also in Victoria.\n\nNon-chemical control: Hand-weeding is only suitable for small infestations, and carries the risk of fragmenting of rhizomes that may then establish elsewhere (Rice Grass Advisory Group 2002).\n\nSmothering the infestation with, for example, opaque plastic sheeting which is left in place for several months can prove very effective (up to 100% kill of Spartina), but is applicable only on small infestations. It is also not selective and is likely to destroy animal, as well as plant, components of the smothered area (Rice Grass Advisory Group 2002).\n\nGrazing reduces biomass, but does not generally destroy the plants (Rice Grass Advisory Group 2002).\n\nChemical control: Treatment with certain herbicides, which are selective to grasses, and appear to be of low toxicity to intertidal invertebrates, can provide good kill (Rice Grass Advisory Group 2002). Also see Shaw & Gosling (1996) for a summary of trials undertaken in New Zealand.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",
    "origin": "Common Cord-grass was derived from Spartina × townsendii, a hybrid between the largely western European species S. maritima and an American species S. alterniflora (Hubbard 1968). The hybrid arose in Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, and on the northern coast of France as a result of the introduction of S. alterniflora into areas where S. maritima was naturally occurring. The hybrid, later described as S. × townsendii, was first noticed in 1870. It was male-sterile (i.e., its anthers contained no fertile pollen), but readily spread by vegetative growth.\n\nIn 1892, it was observed that the sterile hybrid had 'overcome' its sterility through a duplication of chromosomes (a phenomenon known as 'amphipolyploidy'), and was now a sexually reproducing species (Hubbard 1968) and was later named Spartina anglica. Its ability to 'reclaim' mudflats through the accumulation of silt and other debris was soon acknowledged and it became used widely on shallow shores to increase the amount of useable ground (e.g., for pasture) (Hubbard 1968).",

    "similarSpecies": "Other species of Spartina are likely to be confused with Common Cord-grass, and in most, if not all cases, this is likely to be of little consequence, all species having similar consequences to intertidal communities. The major difference between Common Cord-grass (S. anglica) and S. × townsendii (the other species most likely to be encountered) is the presence of larger (longer than 8 mm), fertile anthers in Common Cord-grass. The anthers of S. × townsendii are up to 8 mm long, but do not contain fertile pollen, rendering the plant unable to produce viable seed (Walsh 1994).\n\nIn the vegetative stage, Common Cord-grass may be confused with the Native Common Reed, Phragmites australis [as Phragmites communis], but this is generally a larger plant (to 3 m high or more), with broader leaves that are carried on an erect hollow stem, not mostly tufted at the base as in Spartina. In flower, Native Common Reed is readily distinguished by the feathery flower head that contains very many seeds, each released with a tuft of fine hairs enabling it to become windborne (Walsh 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nBecause grasses in general are a difficult group to identify, where there is any doubt about the identity of a plant suspected of being a Spartina species, specialist help should be sought.",

    "impact": "Agriculture: Johnson Grass is considered to be one of the ten worst weeds in the world (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Washington State NWCB Undated). It causes severe crop losses due to direct competition, chemical inhibition of the growth of other plants and by acting as a host to crop pests and diseases (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) It readily invades arable land, especially in areas of high summer rainfall, and has seriously reduced crop yields in New South Wales and Queensland (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is also a host for the Sorghum Midge (Contarinia sorghicola), as well as the aphid-transmitted sugarcane mosaic virus which causes dwarf mosaic disease in Maize and Sorghum. It also provides a pollen contaminant of nearby cultivated Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) (Cotton Catchment Communities CRC 2007).\n\nJohnson Grass is potentially toxic to livestock. It provides useful forage but at certain developmental stages or under some adverse environmental conditions, Johnson Grass may form cyanogenetic glycosides that can poison livestock. The glycosides are present in sorghum at low levels most of the time. However, acute poisoning is most likely to occur when the plant is growing fast, such as when it rains after a dry spell, and in damp or overcast conditions, or when hungry animals eat a large amount of fresh moist grass. The glycoside when metabolised releases hydrogen cyanide into the blood stream. Cattle tend to be more susceptible than sheep (Hawkins & Lacey 2001; Howard 2004). Other reports state that Johnson Grass is most toxic to animals when it is under stress from frost, drought, when it has been sprayed with herbicide, or has been trampled, especially in young leaves and stems (Howard 2004; Cotton Catchment Communities CRC 2007). Johnson Grass may also sequester selenium (or other elements that are toxic at high doses) when growing in soils with high concentrations of toxic elements. In the Dead Sea area of Jordan, for example, selenium concentrations in Johnson Grass samples were high enough to poison livestock. Prolonged consumption of fresh Johnson Grass can cause nitrate poisoning in animals.\n\nNative ecosystems: South of 32°S in Australia, where rainfall is lower and more evenly spread, Johnson Grass is restricted to roadsides, fence lines, waste places and channel edges; however, it will invade native vegetation, particularly wetlands, from adjoining arable lands (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nUrban environments: Johnson Grass presents a safety hazard on roads by restricting visibility on curves and corners (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board Undated).",
    "controlMethods": "Control of Johnson Grass is difficult because of its ready regeneration from underground stems. Integrated control programmes, in which crop rotation, cultivation, competing crops and chemical measures are combined, usually give the best results (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNon-chemical control: For small infestations, hand-pulling Johnson Grass usually leaves rhizome pieces behind in the soil, stimulating sprouting, so best results are obtained in early spring when soil in moist and rhizomes are least likely to break. Repeated solarization treatments (using a clear polyethylene tarp to trap solar heat in the soil) can also be used (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Howard 2004).\n\nIn cropping situations a consistent tillage program may provide effective control. Flooding for 3–6 weeks in early spring, before underground stems sprout, can also work. Replacing open irrigation ditches with culverts or pipes helps prevent reinfestation. Geese are sometimes used for Johnson Grass control in croplands although they only prefer young shoots, and do not graze tussocks over about 7 inches (18 cm) in height.\n\nFire: Fire may be a useful as long as it is used in conjunction with follow-up herbicide treatments to control underground stem sprouts. Spring burning without further control treatments is not recommended for controlling Johnson Grass, as it is likely to promote sprouting (Howard 2004). Similarly, heavy grazing over two or more years reduces Johnson Grass by depleting underground stem reserves. Rhizome development is greatly reduced when plant height is kept to about 30 cm. Best control is offered when herbicide or winter ploughing treatments follow grazing treatments (Howard 2004). Repeated, close mowing has the same inhibitory effect on growth as grazing (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Howard 2004).\n\nChemical control: The most effective chemical control of Johnson Grass involves using systemic herbicides that ensure the active chemicals reach the underground stems. A single application of herbicide generally does not control large infestations, and follow-up measures are needed for long-term control (Howard 2004). Spraying during the first two weeks of season's growth is recommended (Brown and Brooks 2002). Soil disturbance should be avoided. Follow up with spot spraying and seedling control is important. Different ecotypes may show differential response to herbicides (Howard 2004).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Columbus Grass has a slightly larger seed than Johnson Grass but this difference is usually masked by the normal range of sizes in biological populations (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "habitat": "Perennial Sow-thistle grows best in poorly drained, moist sites that are rich in organic matter, usually on fine-textured soils, especially loams. It prefers slightly alkaline to neutral soils and does not do as well in acidic or highly alkaline soils (Clapham et al. 1962; Lemna & Messersmith 1990; Kravchencko 2006; Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007). In North America it can also establish on dry sites, and sites with little disturbance (McWilliams 2004). In Canada, Perennial Sow-thistle occurs in areas that receive average annual precipitation of 300-3 000 mm (McWilliams 2004). It is also tolerates low levels of salinity (Kravchenko 2006). In North America, it is typically found in cultivated fields, waste areas, moist meadows, woodlands, shores of lakes and rivers, beaches, ditches, lawns, and roadsides (Lemna & Messersmith 1990).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it grows in arable and waste land, is common in abandoned pastures, waysides, dunes and shingle by the sea, ditches and riverbanks (Stace 1997; Bond et al. 2007).\n\nPerennial Sow-thistle is also naturalised in New Zealand, and has been recorded from roadsides, hedges, swamps, and cultivated land (Garnock-Jones 1988).\n\nAccording to Holm et al. (1997) Sonchus arvensis is reported as a weed in 59 countries, and is most often mentioned as a serious weed in cereal crops. It is listed as a serious or principle weed in 15 countries.",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "In Australia, other alien Sow-thistle species, such as Milk Thistle (Sonchus oleraceus), are major weeds of cropping systems, especially in south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales, and the importance of Milk Thistle as a weed appears to be increasing (Widderick et al. 1999; Chauhan et al. 2006). Given the problems caused by other Sow-thistle species in Australia, and the weed history of the Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis) in North America, it is a potentially serious threat to agriculture in climatically suitable areas of Australia (Stajsic pers. comm. 2008).\n\nAgriculture: Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis) is a weed on arable land, and produces competitive plants particularly in annual, agricultural and horticultural crops in regularly cultivated fields. It can cause weed problems in any annual crop in temperate areas. (CABI 2020). Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis) is one of Russia's worst weeds. It infests all types of crops, and also occurs in fallows, vegetable and fruit gardens (Kravchenko 2006). In the United States of America and Canada, where it is naturalised, Perennial Sow-thistle is often an invader of cultivated areas, especially of small grain and row crops (McWilliams 2004; Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007). In Canada, it has been reported as the fifteenth most abundant weed in cereal and oilseed crops surveyed, where it occurred in 39% of rapeseed fields (Peschken et al. 1983). It causes economic loss by reducing crop yields, and increasing cultivation and herbicide expenses. It has reduced spring wheat yields by up to 45% in North Dakota (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007). Perennial Sow-thistle is a host of several important agricultural pests and diseases, such as the potato tuber rot nematode (Ditylenchus destructor) (Lemna & Messersmith 1990; Bond et al. 2007).\n\nNative ecosystems: Sow-thistles are also environmental weeds in Australia. Both the Milk Thistle and the Rough Sow-thistle (Sonchus asper) are considered to be serious environmental weeds in Victoria, where they have invaded at least 13 types of Victorian native vegetation (Carr et al. 1992). Perennial Sow-thistle is a potentially serious environmental weed in climatically suitable areas of Australia because it is long lived, spreads rapidly due to its creeping roots and has a broad ecological range (Stajsic pers. comm. 2008).\n\nUrban areas: Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis)b is a weed of gardens in other parts of the world and could be come problematic in Australia, similar to other Sow-thistles spreading to roadsides, road reserves, neglected and abandoned areas.",
    "controlMethods": "The control of Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis) in Australia should aim to contain and eradicate populations. Ideally, control or eradication should be aimed no later than the rosette stage, prior to the development of the creeping root system, to prevent spread by root fragmentation (Kravchenko 2006). As with Perennial Thistle (Cirsium arvense), another perennial herb in the same family, that also has rhizomes with similar life cycle and requirements as Perennial Sow-thistle, the same or similar control methods should apply.  The best means of control is to prevent initial establishment, or maintaining good quality pasture free from bare areas as germination is always more successful on open sites. If an infestation is established control is problematic because of the rhizomatous nature of the plant. An integrated approach using a combination of strategies is likely to be the most effective.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides probably provide the most effective means of controlling Perennial Sow-thistle, and various types are used in North America (Cowbrough 2005). The same methods and consideration could be employed for Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis) that are for used for Perennial Thistle (Cirsium arvense). Herbicide applications should be effective if the right herbicide is chosen and applied at the right time. As with other thistle species, seedlings are the most susceptible growth stage and provided the plants are growing vigorously, and treatment is applied as soon as germination is complete. Care should be taken to differentiate between seedlings and rosettes that have regrown from root stock as the response to control methods are different. Although the top growth may be susceptible to many herbicides, long term control is difficult to obtain, as it is with most deep rooted perennials.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Isolated plants and small infestations can be physically hand pulled, hoed or grubbed. It is important that all root fragments are collected to prevent any new plants re-establishing from root fragments left buried in soil. The site may require monitoring over several years to ensure that any re-sprouting plants are destroyed.\n\nCompetition and management: Tillage and cultivation of land has varying levels of effectiveness depending on the stage of the life cycle, the type of tillage, and the frequency. It is most effective in the early stages of growth, ideally at the rosette stage, prior to the formation of creeping roots. Fragmentation of the roots may, however, exacerbate the infestation, as root fragments left buried in the soil may develop into new plants. Cultivation of infested areas with mature plants is not advised because broken fragments the rhizome and can seriously spread the problem by moving roots with vegetative buds to new areas. The only exception to this is if the ground can be repeatedly cultivated every couple of weeks to totally prevent emergence of any shoots until the root system is exhausted. It is thought that over about a year the root system will die. However, it may be at least two to three years. In the mean time the land is out of production and this method could also contribute to soil erosion and a breakdown of the soil structure. Pasture species which grow actively in summer, such as Lucerne and Phalaris species, are good competitors and may out compete Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis), as they do for Perennial Thistle (Sonchus arvensis), especially when combined with regular mowing (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Tillage is inappropriate in areas of high quality vegetation (Kravchenko 2006; Bond et al. 2007).\n\nGrazing: In situations where Perennial Sow-thistle is found to be palatable to stock, grazing can be used to reduce flowering and seed set (Stajsic, 2008 pers.comm.).\n\nAlso see CABI (2020) for control methods used around the world.",
    "origin": "Perennial Sow-thistle is native to Europe, Northern Africa and Asia, and is widely naturalised elsewhere (GRIN 2008).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "There are three species of Sonchus in Australia: the alien Rough Sow-thistle (Sonchus asper) and Milk Thistle (Sonchus oleraceus), and Native Sow-thistle, (Sonchus hydrophilus), which is believed to be native. Perennial Sow-thistle differs from these other species in its perennial habit (the others are either annual or biennial), in having creeping roots (the other three species are tap-rooted), and in having narrow oval fruits, which are transversely wrinkled (Thompson 2007).\n\nDune Thistle (Actites megalocarpus) can often be confused with species of Sonchus. It is perhaps most likely to be confused with the Perennial Sow-thistle on account of its perennial, rhizomatous (creeping underground stem) habit. Dune Thistle differs in having smaller flower-heads than Perennial Sow-thistle, 10-20 mm across (compared to 40-50 mm in Perennial Sow-thistle), and larger fruits, 4-8 mm long (compared to 2.5-3.8 mm in Perennial Sow-thistle). The margins of its achenes (fruits) are winged, unlike Perennial Sow-thistle (Jeanes 1999).",

In Australia it is found in semi-arid, temperate and sub-tropical regions (Navie 2004) and in rainfall areas of 250 to 600 mm (Parsons and Cuthbertson 1992), considerably higher than those cited above for American conditions. It is also establishing in higher rainfall areas on the urban fringes around Adelaide in South Australia (Chris Brodie pers. com. 2020). The plant does not appear to have any soil preferences in Australia but in the Americas it is recorded from coarse-textured, sandy soils.",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Silver-leaf Nightshade is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts on agriculture and primary production.  It is estimated that silverleaf nightshade probably causes losses to Australian agriculture of around $80M each year (Heap & Wu 2018).\n\nAgriculture: Silver-leaf Nightshade impacts crops and pastures reducing yields through competition for nutrients and water,  and is difficult to manages so reducing land values.  It can also exude plant growth inhibitors, interfere with animal husbandry and harvesting practices, and is an alternative host for plant eating insects and plant diseases and their vectors (Heap & Wu 2018).  It is actively spreading in the cereal areas of southern Australia and has the potential to spread much more widely. It significantly lowers crop yield (Lemerle & Leys 1991; Hawker 2004) in winter cereal-growing areas and also affects such crops as cotton, sorghum, maize and lucerne. The food reserves in its root system and the ability of the roots to grow deeper than those of most crops allow it to establish itself earlier than any crop it is competing with (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007), and because it is summer-growing it depletes nutrients for later sown winter crops. Silver-leaf Nightshade may support populations of pests harmful to other Solanaceous crops (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007) such as potatoes, capsicums, tomatoes and eggplants.\n\nSilver-leaf Nightshade may also have allelopathic effects in cotton (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The spiny leaves and stems contaminate hay made from infested paddocks (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007).\n\nFruits can be toxic to some livestock. Cattle are more likely to be affected than sheep while goats are not affected at all (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007). Hawker (2004) reports the successful use of sheep and goats for suppressing growing shoots, but stock was not introduced to paddocks where fruits were present on plants in that study.\n\nThe Australian cereal cropping zone hosts a range of valuable major enterprises that are at risk from Silver-leaf Nightshade, including production of cereals (e.g. wheat, barley, triticale, oats), pulses (e.g. peas, beans, lentils, lupins, vetch), oilseeds (e.g. canola), hay, grazing (e.g. sheep, cattle), and myriad minor enterprises. In addition, horticultural enterprises such as wine, vegetable and fruit production are at risk. (Heap & Wu 2018)\n\nNative ecosystems: Carr et al. (1992) suggests that it is not a weed of natural ecosystems, but this may be due to lack of opportunity to this time as recent observation indicate it can spread into and grow in open vegetation in semi-arid environments (Chris Brodie pers. com. 2020).\n\nUrban areas: Known to spread along roadsides and fire breaks and under power-lines, it is also a weed of grassy areas in towns and cities.  Spines on plants may induce an allergic reaction in some people (Botanical Dermatology Database 1994 -). Whether fruits are toxic to man appears not to be documented but American Indians of south-western parts of the United States have used the fruits for converting milk to cheese and they have also used them in tanning of hides (Boyd et al. 1984).",
    "controlMethods": "Silver-leaf Nightshade is extremely difficult to control and so the best prevention is early eradication of plants as soon as they are recognised. Animals should not be allowed to eat fruiting plants, not only because the fruits can be poisonous, but also because it can increase seed dispersal. Vehicles and machinery need to be thoroughly cleaned. Recent studies (Hawker et al. 2006) have shown that there is a great deal of genetic diversity within the South Australian populations and that seeds seem to play the major role in spreading this plant. There are three major goals when managing dense, established infestations: 1) Prevent seed production. 2) Kill shoots during summer/ autumn to protect following crop and pasture yield. 3) Reduce the size and vigour of the root system over time (Heap & Wu 2018).\n\nChemical control: Silver-leaf Nightshade can be difficult to control with herbicides because of the horizontal root system from which new plants are able to establish. Glyphosate and picloram have been found to be effective in other countries. For effective control with chemicals foliar application is required with numerous applications need over 3-5  years to exhaust the root system. For a list of herbicides and methods for use in Australia see Heap and Wu (2018); Smith & Faithfull (1998) . Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Manual (hand) removal or Mechanical (machine removal) is not recommended as roots are deep (up to metres deep) and need to be removed as new plants can grow from the smallest root fragment. Mechanical control that disturbed the roots will only spread roots and stimulate growth of new plants.\n\nCultivation: The ability of Silver-leaf Nightshade plants to re-sprout has meant that mowing or cultivation of the ground is not an option as this disturbed and spreads root fragments which are also capable of producing new plants.\n\nVigorous crops and pastures, especially those based on perennial summer-growing species can significantly suppress Silverleaf Nightshade growth (Heap and Wu 2018). Shading provided a crop canopy could be used a control mechanism in small patches, provided a crop canopy could be established before the plant matures (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007). Given that Silver-leaf Nightshade generally has a competitive advantage this can be difficult to achieve and this method is not likely to be useful in Australia’s broad-acre farming areas, although a crop of Lucerne may be useful in this regard (Smith & Faithfull 1998).\n\nGrazing: by sheep and goats could “reduce the size and number of Silver-leaf Nightshade shoots during the growing season, as well as suppressing flowering and seed set” (Hawker 2004). However, cattle and sheep should not be allowed to eat fruiting plants, not only because the fruits can be poisonous, but also because it can increase seed dispersal. Establishment of new Silver-leaf Nightshade infestations on clean land overwhelmingly originate from seeds ingested by livestock that have eaten ripe fruits. Animals  should be quarantined in a holding zone /paddock in for 7 days before being transport to other areas free of Silver-leaf Nightshade to help reduce risk of spread. The vast majority of seeds pass through animals with 7 days but some may still are excreted  2-3 weeks after ingestion.\n\nDisposal: Any roots that are dug up should be disposed of as root fragments can produce new plants if left in or on the soil.\n\nBiological control: Silver-leaf Nightshade has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. A leaf galling nematode was tested as a biological control agent in Victoria in the 1980s but because it was found to affect other Solanum species grown as crops it was not able to be released. Other biological control agents have been tested but were also found to impact closely related crop plants. No biological agent is available in Australia.",
    "origin": "For many years it had been unclear whether Silver-leaf Nightshade originated in North America or South America but recent DNA studies have shown its relationships lie with other Mexican and southern USA species of Solanum and so this is likely to be its area of origin, with  and recent studies confirming that Silver-leaf Nightshade is probably native to the Monterrey region of north-eastern Mexico (Heap & Wu 2018). Early American colonists were presumably responsible for its spread outside this region into other areas of the Americas (Levin et al. 2006).  It is now a weed in may areas outside it native range.",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Silver-leaf Nightshade is a member of the very distinctive Solanum group of plants and shares with the rest of the members of the genus the very distinctive Solanum flower shape (e.g. potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums) with 5 star-shaped petals with 5 prominent yellow stamens at right-angles to the petals.\n\nHowever there are some 180 species of Solanum in Australia, many of them native and so care needs to be taken in identification, particularly as many of the native species may also occupy roadside and other areas of disturbance and look superficially similar. The silvery appearance may be helpful but because there are so many similar species it is best that confirmation of an identification of Silver-leaf Nightshade is made by your local weeds officer or by the herbarium in your state or territory.",

    "habitat": "Variegated Thistle (Silybum marianum) is found in well-watered temperate regions of southern Australia on fertile soils of alluvial or volcanic origin, and on some sandy or sandy loam soils. It is common on sheep and cattle camps in pastures and can spread, out-competing desirable species. It is also found on cultivated land, roadsides, stockyards, and disturbed neglected areas and disturbed areas in woodlands and open forests (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Variegated Thistle (Silybum marianum) is found on roadsides and in waste areas, in pastures and occasionally in crops. It is a highly competitive weed once it starts to establish and due to the size of its rosette and its ability to compete for light, nutrients and moisture it shades out other species. Establishment is favoured by bare ground or sparse pasture, consequently infestations often occur on stock camps, rabbit warrens and cultivated fire breaks. Variegated thistle has a high early growth rate, which allows it to out-compete many pasture seedlings (Government of South Australia 2021). When the thistle plants die in summer the ground is left bare and open for re-establishment of Variegated Thistle and other weeds in autumn. Variegated Thistle grows best in areas of high fertility and a weed of cultivated land, roadsides, neglected areas, generally replaces existing plants. In addition to its actual impacts, it also receives some attention because of its size and spiny, non-native appearance\n\nAgriculture: A highly competitive weed once it starts to establish in pastures. Due to the size of its rosette and its ability to compete for light, nutrients and moisture it shades out more desirable pasture species. Where established in areas cut for hay it will contaminate the fodder reducing its value and enabling further dispersal of the weed. Where Variegated Thistle can get established in natural plant communities it is also able to displace native species through its competitive ability (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Its prickly nature and its ability to form a dense sward make access and control using hand tools difficult, and can also deter stock and wildlife while harbouring vermin like rabbits. Variegated Thistle is often eaten by stock after being cut or sprayed, as are dead plants in summer. Stock will also eat the leafy green plants. However grazing of fresh green growth in winter can cause serious stock poisoning because of the high nitrate content of the foliage, especially on cloudy days in wet weather or when soil moisture is high. The spines on the leaves can damage the digestive tract of grazing animals (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992), especially of cattle (Government of South Australia 2021). Also grows in some cops and place such as sheep camps and stock-yards.\n\nNative ecosystems: Occasionally found in native grassy lands or open or degraded areas.  Can be found on the edge of and in roadside vegetation. Normally not found in dense healthy woodlands. During seed development the seed-heads are sought after by Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, Galahs and Crimson Rosellas as a food (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nUrban areas: Found on roadside and disturbed are like machinery yards and abandoned areas, little cared for grassy areas, and on the edge of creek lines.",
    "controlMethods": "Variegated Thistle (Silybum marianum) can be controlled by herbicides to kill plants when young, by physical means; grubbing killing if roots are moved, and managed but rarely killed by mechanical means to reduce seed set, and with cultural practices, with grazing animals (caution is and can be toxic to animal in larger quantities). Predominantly a weed of cultivated land on fertile soils, on these areas with existing infestations control will obviously depend on acreage infested and weed density. The best means of control is prevention through good pasture management with of cover of desirable species.\n\nChemical control: Herbicide applications at seedling and rosette stages are most effective, as the plants become more tolerant of the herbicide as they mature. Spray-grazing, where spraying with a herbicide is followed by a short interval of a couple of weeks of no grazing, then grazing the herbicide-affected plants, is also effective in reducing infestations. In any herbicide program the habitat once occupied by the weed needs to be filled with productive, competitive pasture species for ongoing farming benefit and continued weed control (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow 1996). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Small patches of variegated thistle can be chipped with a hoe, provided most of the taproot is also removed.\n\nMechanical control: Slashing or mowing may reduce seed set, but is ineffective at killing variegated thistles. Mowing plants of Variegated Thistle before flowers open is also effective but the cut plants, now wilted, can cause nitrate poisoning if eaten by livestock, especially if conditions are moist (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nCompetition and management: The best defence against invasion by Variegated Thistle (Silybum marianum) on agricultural lands is to maintain healthy perennial pasture with good ground cover at all times, especially in summer going into autumn to prevent seedling establishment. On the highly fertile sites where this species is often found, summer-growing pasture species such as Phalaris and lucerne are effective in out-competing germinating and establishing thistle seedlings. Winter annual species such as ryegrass and clover generally are not effective (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nCultivation of the ground when young seedlings are present will kill those seedlings, but establishing a competitive pasture is then vital for continued control of the species.\n\nGrazing by goats has been shown to be effective against Variegated Thistle as they selectively graze leaves and heads that are setting seed and thus can reduce overall seedset and prevent buildup of the soil seed store. Sheep grazing is ineffective (Holst & Allan 1996).\n\nQuick grazing with high stocking rates of sheep in autumn just after thistles have germinated will greatly reduce seedling numbers. Grazing must be managed carefully however as overgrazing may weaken the pasture, allowing the thistles to colonise bare areas and successfully compete with the weakened grass.\n\nBiological control: Variegated Thistle has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allowed activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. The receptacle weevil Rhinocyllus conicus has been released in Victoria but its extent and effectiveness is unknown.   It is likely that this will be at its most effective in large infestations so populations of the weevil can build up (see Bruzzese et al. 1998).",

Common along parts of the coast on sand dunes and road sides.\n\nAgriculture: Bladder Campion can form dense patches that limit growth of crops.

As it sheds its seed at around the same time as several pasture species, it is likely to contaminate seed harvested from the pasture (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Bladder Campion impacts on pasture production, although it can be grazed by livestock and is not known to be poisonous. It is an invader in uncompetitive pastures and crops, and also a nuisance in perennial horticulture where herbicides that destroy it cannot be used\n\nNative ecosystems:  On sandy coasts it competes with native herbaceous species and it has been reported as invasive in dry coastal vegetation. It is particularly common on some beaches of the southern Mornington Peninsula in Victoria (Carr et al. 1992; Walsh 2008).\n\nUrban areas: Can be a persistent weed in neglected and abandoned gardens, and spreading under (or over) fence lines.",

Bladder Campion is also hairless to sparsely hairy, while these other species are softly hairy. There are many other naturalised species of Silene in Australia, but the majority of these are annuals, and lack the substantial root system of Bladder Campion. The family Caryophyllaceae contains many weedy species with some characteristics shared with Bladder Campion (e.g. paired leaves, white, deeply notched petals), but the many veined calyx is a characteristic of Silene in particular, and the inflated calyx, of Bladder Campion in particular (Adams 1996).",

Small outbreaks can be grubbed out before flowering, with care being taken to cut the root well below the surface to prevent or minimise regrowth. Larger areas can be controlled through repeated cultivation but this may not be practical.\n\nGenerals slashing of plants before flowering help reduce seed production in infected areas. The spread of seed from infected paddocks to uninfected paddocks can be reduced if stock are yarded for four to five days before hand, this allowing time for digested seed to have been excreted and seed attached to their hides to have been brushed off (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nSowing of well-fertilised \"improved\" pastures results in a more dense pasture which inhibits the growth of Paddy's Lucerne. However, care should be taken when deciding what to plant. Pasture species such as Buffel Grass are also serious environmental weeds (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: Seedlings to 10 cm high are susceptible to early post-emergence herbicides, but plants become resistant to most herbicides as they mature (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nFor general information of the use of chemicals please visit the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority at http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nBiological control: Paddy's Lucerne has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. The chrysomelid beetle Calligrapha pantherina has been a successful biological control agent of Spinyhead Sida (S. acuta) and has also been released on Paddy's Lucerne at a number of sites in Queensland. It established at several sites in north Queensland, but failed to establish on populations in southern Queensland. C. pantherina was released in NSW in 1990 and that the beetles Calligrapha felina and Acanthoscelides brevipes were being investigated as possible control agents in the Northern Territory (Julien & Griffiths 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "similarSpecies": "Paddy's Lucerne is most likely to be confused with other species of Sida, especially Flannel Weed (S. cordifolia) and Spinyhead Sida (S. acuta). It may also be confused with S. spinosa, S. subspicata, Malvastrum americanum and M. coromandelianum (Navie 2004).\n\nPaddy's Lucerne has oval (elliptic), lance-shaped (lanceolate) or diamond-shaped (rhomboid) leaves with a dense covering of hairs on their undersides and a sparse covering of hairs on their upper surfaces. These leaves usually have rounded tips (obtuse apices). Its flowers are borne singly on long and thin stalks (10–40 mm long) and their bracts (calyces) are sparsely hairy. The fruit usually break up into 8–12 mericarps that are topped with two short awns (0.5–1 mm long) (Navie 2004).\n\nFlannel Weed has broad or heart-shaped (cordate) leaves that are densely covered in small whitish coloured hairs (on both surfaces) that give them a felty texture. Its flowers are borne in small, dense, clusters on short stalks (2–4 mm long) and their bracts (calyces) are densely hairy (unlike the sparsely hairy bracts of Paddy's Lucernne). The mericarps have longer, slender awns (2.5–3.5 mm long) (Navie 2004).\n\nSpinyhead Sida has elongated (lanceolate) leaves that are hairless or sparsely hairy on both surfaces and have pointed tips (acute apices), not rounded as in Paddy's Lucerne. Its flowers are borne singly or in small clusters on short stalks (2–8 mm long). The fruit break up into 5–8 wedge-shaped mericarps (Navie 2004).\n\nSpiny Sida has flowers are borne singly or in small clusters on relatively short stalks (3–15 mm long). The fruit usually break up into only 5 mericarps (Navie 2004).\n\nSpiked Sida (Sida subspicata) has relatively narrow (lanceolate) to broad (ovate or oblong) leaves with a dense covering of hairs on both surfaces (but more so underneath). Its flowers are almost stalkless and borne in elongated clusters (spikes) with a few small leaves sometimes interspersed between them. Their bracts (calyces) are finely hairy and the fruit break up into 4–6 mericarps that have rounded tips (Navie 2004).\n\nMalvastrum species can be distinguished from Sida species because the flowers have what is known as an epicalyx, in this case 3 free segments situated immediately below the calyx, which species of Sida lack (Barker, unpubl. manuscript)",

In the Northern Territory, together with Spinyhead Sida (Sida acuta), Flannel Weed occasionally dominates over-grazed pastures, especially around water troughs and stockyards. These weeds are probably the most serious competitors of sown pasture in the moister northern parts of Australia. They are rarely eaten by stock which, grazing the more palatable species to a greater extent, give these weeds a competitive advantage that is increased by their deep root systems which extend their growing season beyond that of their shallower rooted competitors (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nFlannel Weed invades grasslands and open woodlands (Navie 2004).

Together with a related species, S. cordifolia (Flannel Weed), it has been described as one of the most serious weeds of crops and pastures in the Top End of the Northern Territory. Although it is grazed occasionally, infested areas are usually ignored by stock. In consequence, the animals eat more of the remaining species, reducing their competitiveness and favouring the spread and persistence of the weed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Spinyhead Sida also invades open woodlands (Navie 2004). Once plants become established they are very competitive, holding and denying sites to other plants, in part due to their tough woody stems and deep taproots (PIER 2006).",

A biological control agent, the Mexican Leaf-feeding chrysomelid beetle (Calligrapha pantherina), which was released at 80 sites in the Northern Territory between 1989 and 1992, readily established near the coast and provided substantial control (Flanagan et al. 2000). Two stem-boring weevils, species of the genus Eutinobothrus, were also released in Australia in 1994 and 1996 in the hope that they will control the weed in drier areas (Forno et al. 1997-2004).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",

Seeds of Whorled Pigeon Grass are well adapted to dispersal by animals because of the retrorse barbs on the bristles of the inflorescences. The fruiting panicle attaches itself to the fur of passing animals by means of the retrorsely-barbed bristles and thereby achieves wide distribution of the seeds.\n\nAgriculture: Whorled Pigeon Grass is a potential seed contaminant (GRIN 2008) and a crop weed, especially of maize. As well as competing with a very wide range of tropical and temperate crops, it can cause difficulties during harvesting when the inflorescences become entangled with themselves and with the crop (CABI 2021). Not a problem in pastures as it is palatable.\n\nUrban environments: It is also a nuisance weed of gardens, roadsides, footpaths and wasteland (Edgar & Connor 2000).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Sicklepod and Foetid Senna were included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Sicklepod and Foetid Senna were not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, they remain weeds of potential national signficance.\n\nAgriculture: Sicklepod and Foetid Senna are aggressive invaders of pasture and can completely dominate grass species, eradicating pasture growth and excluding stock. Carrying capacities can be reduced by as much as 85%. It is conceivable that properties could become completely unproductive. Although it is generally unpalatable to stock, if eaten, Sicklepod is toxic to cattle. If left to grow in a sugar cane crop, Sicklepod can have a significant effect on yield. Processing contaminated cane can cause machinery breakdowns at sugar mills because of the woody nature of Sicklepod.\n\nNative ecosystems: Sicklepod is also causing concern as an environmental weed in some native ecosystems in Far North Queensland. Its current distribution suggests that it may be able to invade open native plant communities. Feral cattle, feral pigs and the occurrence of natural events such as cyclone, which open up the forest canopy, are likely to enhance the possibility of invasion into pristine areas and it is currently threatening small remnant areas of native grassland in the Wet Tropics. While there is no evidence that Sicklepod is currently an aggressive environmental weed in Australia, this may be because its impact is not yet evident. The information available suggests that its environmental impacts may increase in the future (Mackey et al. 1997).",
    "controlMethods": "Sicklepod and Foetid Senna can be controlled by herbicide application to seedlings, mechanically such as by slashing, fire, and vehicle hygiene (Mackey et al. 1997; Land Protection 2006).\n\nChemical control: Herbicide is only effective on seedlings and new regrowth as the cuticle on mature plants is thick and provides protection from herbicides (Mackey et al. 1997; Land Protection 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Slashing does not kill the plants but can be undertaken to reduce old plants to a manageable size, and/or to obtain a fair percentage kill if certain conditions are met. Sharp slasher blade cuts will encourage the plant to reshoot so blunt blades should be used to shatter the stems of the plant. Slashing should always be done prior to seed set preferably when plants are flowering. Repeated slashing over a number of years may cause the plants to become procumbent, in which state they can still produce seed. A combination of slashing and spraying regrowth has been successful (Mackey et al. 1997; Land Protection 2006).\n\nRotary hoeing or discing infested areas and immediately sowing with improved pastures can be effective, provided that the grasses are well managed. Ploughing can be unsuccessful as it can cause scarification of the seed and a proliferation of plants (Mackey et al. 1997; Land Protection 2006).\n\nAll machinery should be cleaned on site following mechanical control in order to reduce possible seed spread into clean areas (Mackey et al. 1997; Land Protection 2006).\n\nFire is only used in controlled management plans as fire scarifies the seed and can cause a proliferation of plants. If used strategically over a number of years it can be a valuable tool for managing sicklepod (Mackey et al. 1997; Land Protection 2006).\n\nSicklepod and Foetid Senna have also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.",

The seed pods angle upwards from the stems, are 15 to 25 cm long, about 1.8 cm wide, and have prominent wings running along the sides (Van Rangelrooy 2000).\n\nSee taxonomic texts such as Flora of Australia Volume 12 (Randall & Barlow 1998) for detailed distinguishing features of Sennas in Australia, as sicklepod and Foetid Senna are similar to many native species of Senna.",

    "controlMethods": "Prevention is the best method for controlling Hairy Senna, however it can be controlled by physical and chemical means.\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual control: Slashing can be undertaken to reduce old plants to a manageable size; however, this alone will not kill the plants. Slashing should be carried out while the plants are flowering and before seed set. Rotary hoeing or discing infested areas and immediately sowing with improved pasture can be effective, provided that the grasses are well managed and spot spraying of individual Hairy Senna plants is carried out. Maintaining the improved pasture helps to exclude sunlight and maintain soil moisture which hastens the decomposition of the seed reserves and limits seed germination. To help prevent spread stock should not graze in paddocks containing Hairy Senna. Machinery should be cleaned on site to stop possible spread.\n\nChemical control: Chemical control by spraying is most effective on young seedlings and it becomes more difficult, requiring more herbicide, with increasing plant age (Land Protection 2006, QLD DAF 2020).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

In areas unsuitable for cultivation, such as steep hillsides, seedlings can be heavily grazed by sheep or goats, neither of which has yet shown any ill effects in Australia (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).

    "habitat": "Fireweed is generally found on roadsides, in pasture, and adjacent open forest and prefers areas of bare soil to become established. It needs moist conditions for seedling establishment, but will grow and flower at any time of year other than mid-winter, given the rainfall. From germination to flowering can take as little as 6 weeks. Plants behave as annuals in southern areas, because they are frost tender, but may over-winter and behave as short-lived perennials further north (Miles undated).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Fireweed is a Weed of National Significance (WONS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nAgriculture: Fireweed is an introduced weed that competes strongly with pasture species and is toxic to livestock, causing liver damage. It is responsible for illness, slow growth and poor conditioning of cattle and can result in death. All growth stages contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids that damage the liver. Fireweed is toxic when green or dry therefore contaminated hay or silage may be toxic. Fireweed is generally unpalatable to cattle, so poisoning is most likely to occur when Fireweed plants are dense and stock can not feed selectively, or when there is a shortage of pasture and hungry stock are less selective about food. Sheep and goats are less susceptible to Fireweed poisoning and can graze in Fireweed infested paddocks for at least one season. Toxins found in Fireweed are able to taint the milk of goats that graze this plant. Goats for milk production should not be allowed to graze in Fireweed infested paddocks (Land Protection 2006).",
    "controlMethods": "The best approach to Fireweed control is to prevent it establishing by ensuring that there is a dense cover of pasture in autumn and winter. Waiting until autumn to begin pasture improvement will worsen the Fireweed problem because Fireweed, which germinates in autumn, will be promoted ahead of the pasture by fertilising and direct drilling of winter pasture species. When small infestations of Fireweed are identified, act immediately to prevent the situation from becoming worse and to increase the likelihood of eradication (Land Protection 2006).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides are most effective if sprayed before plants reach maturity. However, application during flowering will be effective if higher recommended rates of herbicide are applied. Trials have shown herbicide application in the autumn period during April provides good control (Land Protection 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Plants can be chipped out as long as they are bagged and burnt or disposed of at council approved land fill tips.\n\nYou should not burn plants in household wood burning stoves or heaters. Remove chipped out plants from paddocks because they may still set seed and poison stock (Land Protection 2006).\n\nSlashing is usually not effective as it may lead to increased stock poisoning. Slashing tends to give a good visual effect because it removes the flowers but at best it delays flowering and seeding and at worst it damages the pasture, making conditions more favourable for Fireweed. Fireweed remains toxic after being cut and becomes more attractive to stock and thus more likely to cause poisoning (Land Protection 2006).\n\nBiological control: Fireweed has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. A number of organisms can be found attacking Fireweed, but any effect they have is temporary and isolated. An orange rust (Puccinia lagenophorae) is common and often affects Fireweed particularly in lower country. The blue stem borer moth, (Patagoniodes farinari) is also common, but the larvae usually develop too slowly to have an impact. Two moths imported from Madagascar were host tested. In controlled tests they were found to feed important non-target plants so no releases were made and all these insects were destroyed. Other potential biological control agents have been identified, but rigorous testing is needed to ensure that they do not feed on closely related Australian native plants (Land Protection 2006).",
    "origin": "Fireweed is native to Madagascar and southern Africa (Land Protection 2006).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "There are many other weedy yellow daisies. Most of these consist of a single basal rosette and flower stalks arising from the centre, rather than having a bushy, branched habit. Their flowers tend to be a deeper yellow than those of Fireweed (Miles undated; PlantNET 2007).\n\nThere are also numerous native herbs in the genus Senecio. Among these, Fireweed can be distinguished by its 13-15 ‘petals’, and fibrous root system. Two very similar natives are Senecio pinnatifolius var. maritimus which occurs on sea cliffs and dunes and has fleshier leaves and a taproot, and S. pinnatifolius var. lanceolatus which occurs in wet grassy forest along the top of the coastal escarpment. The latter has a more spreading, lax habit than the weed and slightly larger flowers. Senecio madagascariensis may also occur behind beaches or on top of the escarpment, so check the appearance of the plant as well as the location before making an identification (Miles undated; PlantNET 2007).\n\nThe large clumping native perennial, Senecio linearifolius, can behave in a weedy way around the edges of the farming areas, where it colonises after fire or other disturbance. If in doubt, get a specimen professionally identified (Miles undated; PlantNET 2007).",

    "habitat": "Ragwort favours heavy soils of moderate fertility. The heaviest infestations occur on rather poor land which has been cleared in the past but never properly developed for agriculture, or on run-down pastures and grasslands. Pastures grazed by cattle are particularly prone to Ragwort invasion as the death of desirable plants from cattle hooves leaves openings for seedlings to establish. As cattle normally avoid grazing Ragwort it has a competitive advantage over other pasture plants that are grazed.\n\nRagwort will also invade dry coastal vegetation, heathland & heathy woodland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, damp sclerophyll forest, wet sclerophyll forest, riparian vegetation, freshwater wetlands (DPIWE 2002; DSE 2004).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WoNS). Following an assessment process, Ragwort was not included as one of the 20 WoNS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. Ragwort is a serious agricultural and environmental weed. It is steadily invading pasture and native vegetation across southern Victoria.\n\nAgriculture: Ragwort contains alkaloid toxins that, if eaten by horses or any grazing animal, can have debilitating or fatal consequences. The highest concentration of toxin is found in the pollen, then in order, the leaves, stems and roots. The effect of the toxin is cumulative and irrevocable, and as it builds up in the body results in liver failure. The build up is undetectable until it finally reaches the critical level at which symptoms occur (DPIWE 2002; AgResource 2006). Dairy cattle forced to eat Ragwort produce tainted milk (McLaren & Faithfull 2004). In addition to its health impacts, Ragwort is a major pasture weed particularly on land grazed by cattle and horses and on dairy farms. Dairy cattle forced to graze ragwort produce tainted milk. It produces dense foliage close to the ground which suppresses and prevents regeneration of other vegetation. Ragwort competes strongly with more desirable plants, reducing pasture productivity and the value of agricultural land, and can be invasive in forestry plantations (Agriculture Victoria 2021). The ability of each Ragwort plant to produce tens of thousands of seeds, combined with its capacity to regenerate from root or crown fragments, gives Ragwort an amazing capacity to spread. Once established, Ragwort can overwhelm pasture and reduce its livestock carrying capacity (DPIWE 2002; AgResource 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems:  Ragwort can be invasive on roadsides, native forests and woodlands, threatening biodiversity in these areas.\n\nUrban areas: Ragwort can also be invasive on roadsides, and on urban fringes.",
    "controlMethods": "Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) can be treated by chemical and physical means. Mechanical control is not always advisable, especially on established populations and this can break up and further spread roots that regrow in to new plants. Physical control involves handling Ragwort and operators must wear suitable protective clothing i.e. skin covered up, neoprene / rubber gloves, and pollen mask if the plants are flowering (DPIWE 2002) as the plant is potential toxic to humans and well as animals.\n\nChemical control: Effective chemical control requires a minimum 2-year spray eradication program with applications twice a year in the autumn and spring. Sprays should be targeted at seedlings or 1st year rosettes wherever possible as higher levels of control are achieved from each application, the smaller plants rot down more quickly (allowing livestock back into the area sooner), and less chemical is required minimising the effect on the environment. When treating Ragwort in grass intended for conservation (e.g. as hay / silage) autumn treatment is always the preferred timing, as spring treatment may not leave sufficient time for the dead Ragwort to rot away completely before the grass is cut and baled (DPIWE 2002). For further information on chemical control please see: Agriculture Victoria 2021; DPIRD 2021; DPI NSW 2019; and please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: There is now evidence that humans may also be at serious risk from Ragwort poisoning through direct contact such as hand pulling without wearing protective gloves, or breathing in high quantities of pollen. For this reason it is essential that anyone handling Ragwort minimises skin contact and wears rubber gloves, and if in regular contact with flowering Ragwort, a dust mask with a pollen filter (DPIWE 2002; AgResource 2006).\n\nMechanical control: Digging, hand-pulling or mechanical pulling are all options, but all these methods allow potential re-growth from detached roots left in the soil. Second year plants must be removed from site before flowering as in addition to increasing risk of seed regeneration it also increases the risk to operator from alkaloid toxin exposure in the pollen as well as from the leaves and stems.\n\nCompetition and management: Maintenance of a dense vigorous pasture will reduce the opportunity for seedlings to establish and help to prevent the spread of Ragwort. This requires the judicious use of fertilisers and grazing management to avoid both overgrazing and under-grazing (DPIWE 2002).\n\nSome farmers use grazing by sheep in an effort to control Ragwort as winter and spring grazing by sheep weakens plants. However sheep grazing will not eliminate Ragwort and the risk to the health of animals on heavily infested fields means that vets now discourage this technique (DPIWE 2002).\n\nRagwort control in poorly accessible areas may be best achieved by fencing off the area and allowing it to return to bush, or by the establishment of tree plantations. The control is achieved mainly by shading, with a contribution from plant competition (particularly in regenerating bush) and reduction in seed dispersal due to windbreak effects (McLaren & Faithfull 2004).\n\nBiological Control: Several biological control programs are active in Tasmania and Victoria. The Ragwort Flea Beetle, Longitarsus flavicornis, which is a natural predator of Ragwort in Europe, was introduced to Tasmania in 1979. In 2000, field surveys indicated that the Ragwort Flea Beetle had spread over 90% of the total area of land infested by Ragwort. Within this area it is now starting to have a significant impact on Ragwort. Five insect species introduced to Victoria to control Ragwort, including the Ragwort Flea Beetle, have established (DPIWE 2002; McLaren et al. 1999; McLaren & Faithfull 2004).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Galvanised Burr (Sclerolaena birchii) is a pioneer species on soil denuded of vegetation by drought, overgrazing or erosion. It quickly colonizes bare overgrazed and drought effected pasture when rainfall occurs. (Everist et al. 1976). Light infestations can perform a useful function as a soil stabilizer acting as a trap for seed and other debris and protecting seedlings (Everist et al. 1976). Although the plant population increases rapidly after rain it slowly declines as it is affected by water stress. (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nAgriculture: It competes with useful pasture species and in dense infestations the spines may hinder the movement of stock (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Very heavy infestations of Galvanised Burr are reported to reduce stock-carrying capacity (Everist et al. 1976). Mature plants are not usually grazed because of the spines on the burrs along its stems (Auld 1981). However, seedlings and shoot tips can be a useful fodder in drought (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The burrs are a contaminant in wool, and an annoyance to sheep and wool handlers.  The burrs are not generally considered a major vegetable fault in the wool (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Not normally a problem in intact native vegetation. It becomes abundant in areas subjected to long-term drought after rains. It is symptomatic of overgrazing and degraded rangelands (Auld & Johnson 2011).\n\nUrban areas: Not known to be problematic in and around urban areas.",
    "controlMethods": "Galvanised Burr (Sclerolaena birchii)is known to be native in much of the range it is considered problematic. It is also known to have extended its distribution via sheep and cattle in the rangelands where it can also problematic. Eradication of Galvanised Burr is neither practical nor appropriate (Auld & Johnson 2011), and a high level of control is generally not economically justifiable. The over-abundance and prominence of the species is linked to overgrazing and drought (Auld & Johnson 2011) with the aim of a control programs on grazing land to minimise the amount of seed entering the seed bank. This approach will reduce the occurrence and severity of future infestations (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nChemical control:  Spot infestations of Galvanised burr that may appear in the southern grazing areas are readily controlled with non-selective herbicides Government of South Australia, (2014).  If herbicide are used, dead plants need to be collected and burnt (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) killing the seeds contained with the fruit.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: can effectively be used Mechanical control: Plants can be grubbed from the ground and heaped for burning using a tractor-mounted blade. Seedlings will establish after the parent plants are removed and cultivation can then be used to control the populations of seedlings. Deep cultivation to bury the seed with pasture improvement and grazing management will give control. Re-infestation can be dealt with by grazing seedlings before they are 6 weeks old (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). However grazing management on its own will do little to prevent the plant from re-establishing from seed because the plant germinates mainly in winter when competition from native grasses is minimal (Everist et al. 1976).\n\nCompetition and management: Not normally a problem in well managed areas not subjected to over grazing. However, small infestations of Galvanised Burr can be dealt with by careful pasture management, encouraging desired pasture species with topdressing and appropriate grazing, with complete removal of all burrs (containing seed) if possible.\nBiological control: There are no biological controls except for the effect of native insects and fungi on the root system of the plant. Studies into the use of these native pests as a control measure where undertaken in the 1930s with little success (Everist et al. 1976).",
    "origin": "Galvanised Burr is endemic to Australia in summer-rainfall/semi-arid New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory extending into far northern South Australia. It is common in Poplar Box (Eucalyptus populnea) and White Cypress-pine (Callitris columellaris) woodlands on light-textures soils (Cooke 2007).",
    "growthForm": "Shrub",
    "similarSpecies": "Other species of Sclerolaena may appear similar to Galvanised Burr, but the hairy fruit with 5 long, straight spines and the obovate leaves distinguish it from other species (Harden 2007).",

    "habitat": "In its natural range, Broad-leaf Pepper Tree is reported to occur as scattered individuals in a variety of habitats, from sea level to over 700 m elevation (Ferriter 1997).\n\nBroad-leaf Pepper Tree has a relatively broad ecological range, but typically invades near damp or wet coastal sites, as well as coastal dunes, open forest and disturbed areas such roadsides and pasture. It tolerates both flooding and drought, freshwater, saline and semi-saline communities. In Hawaii it occurs in sites as high as 920 m above sea level (Wagner et al. 1999)\n\nBroad-leaf Pepper Tree has a preference for mesic, usually frost-free, warmer regions of the world. It is tolerant of semi-saline conditions and in Florida it is also an invader of the salt marsh-mangrove transition zone (Ferriter 1997). It has shown the same ability in Queensland and Western Australia (FloraBase 2007; National Herbarium of Victoria 2007). It tends to be sensitive to cold temperatures (Hall et al. 2006).\n\nIt is moderately tolerant of shade and can persist under forest canopies, spreading in response to disturbance. Seedlings are quickly killed by flooding, but large plants can tolerate inundation for up to 6 months. It is very drought resistant and has been recommended for planting for fire resistant barriers around homes in the United States, particularly in California (e.g., Bonnot & McCormac 2003).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Broad-leaf Pepper Tree was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Broad-leaf Pepper Tree was not included as one of the 20 WONS; however, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nBroad-leaf Pepper Tree is an aggressive pioneer species of wetland and riparian ecosystems. It has invaded many native vegetation communities in Australia, and poses a threat to species diversity in more intact ecosystems. Currently it is chiefly an environmental weed. It can rapidly colonise disturbed and undisturbed vegetation in wetland and riparian ecosystems, as well as coastal dunes, and may suppress re-establishment of native vegetation in the early successional stages of these ecosystems (Csurhes & Edwards 1998; Ensbey 2002). The shading effect and its allelopathic (inhibitory) properties can further prevent re-establishment of native vegetation (Gogue et al. 1974)\n\nIn Perth, Western Australia, it is becoming a major concern as an invader of coastal and near coastal wetlands, lakes and streams (Hussey et al. 1997; Keighery 2007, pers. comm.). At Thornlie it has invaded Eucalyptus rudis woodland along the Canning River foreshore, where it is a serious weed in that part of the river, and is often locally dominant (FloraBase 1998 -). At Blue Gum Lake it occurs in Eucalyptus rudis and Melaleuca rhaphiophylla woodland, and at the former delta of the Preston River at Bunbury it is naturalised on the edge of a Juncus kraussii marsh (FloraBase 1998 -). At Northampton it occurs along a creek in Acacia shrubland. It can also invade drier sites, and has been reported as naturalised in coastal heath at Rockingham.\n\nIn Queensland it is also generally an invader of mesic coastal or near coastal sites, but also occurs well inland. At Jacobs Well it occurs in Melaleuca quinquenervia woodland. At Ormiston it is invading mangroves, Melaleuca, Casuarina, Eucalyptus wetland forest at Boondall Wetlands Reserve, disturbed gallery, microphyll vine forest at Bundaberg, and at Degilbo it is invading Corymbia tessellaris, Eucalyptus crebra and E. tereticornis association on alluvium (National Herbarium of Victoria 2007). In northeast Queensland it is a riparian invader at Wild River at Hertberton. Broad-leaf Pepper Tree is considered to be one of the most invasive naturalised plants in south-eastern Queensland (Batianoff & Butler 2002).\n\nIn New South Wales the largest infestation occurs at Mullumbimby, where it has naturalised along the river and the roadside (Ensbey 2002). At Cape Byron it is invading Melaleuca–Eucalyptus lowland woodland, and at Hastings Point it occurs in beach scrub, in the hind dune areas among Banksia, Cupaniopsis, Alectryon, Acronychia, Schefflera community (National Herbarium of Victoria). It is also naturalised west of Moree. It is an 'alert weed' for the northern suburbs of Sydney (SydneyWeeds Committees 2007).\n\nDense stands can form around water holes and impede the access to water for stock, and interfere with mustering (Ensbey 2002). They also cast deep shade and prevent establishment of an herbaceous understorey (Cronk & Fuller 1995).\n\nIt is also an alternate host for mango black spot disease, and a host of witches broom disease in citrus (Ensbey 2002).\n\nBroad-leaf Pepper Tree is known to affect human and animal health as it contains toxic resins. Contact with the sap can cause persistent swelling, rashes, welts, running sores, swollen faces, colic and haemorrhages in the eyes. When flowering, the pollen can cause sneezing, asthma-like reactions and headache. The fruit if eaten is known to cause vomiting and diarrhoea (Queensland Poisons Information Centre 2007). Extensive bird deaths have also been reported in Florida from eating the fruit (Morton 1978). Horses that have been resting beneath the trees have developed dermatitis and swollen faces, similar to symptoms in humans (Ensbey 2002). Consumption by horses and cattle can cause haemorrhages, intestinal complication and fatal colic (Morton 1978). However, there are also reports of goats browsing on the foliage with no ill effects (Francis undated).",
    "controlMethods": "The type of control applied will depend on the degree of infestation. Isolated seedlings can be hand-pulled. Large trees can be cut down, the stump dug out and removed. If the stumps are not removed or brushed with herbicide, regrowth will occur through coppicing and root-suckering (Ensbey 2002). Foliar herbicide application can be used on seedlings (PIER 2005).\n\nMore detailed information on control in Australia is available form the New South Wales Department of Agriculture (Enseby 2002), the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Water (Land Protection 2006) and Panetta & Anderson (2001).

The leaflets are also broader in Broad-leaf Pepper Tree (10-30 mm), compared to 2-10 mm wide in Pepper Tree. The two species also differ in the length to width ratio of the leaflets, in Broad-leaf Pepper Tree the leaflet length is 1.5-3 times that of the width, compared with 3-6 times in Pepper Tree (Jessup 1985).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst aquatic weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nRecreational activities: An infestation can cover the entire surface of a water body, reducing aesthetic values and preventing most recreational activities such as swimming, boating, water sports, and recreational fishing (Oosterhout 2006).\n\nAgriculture and fisheries: Commercial fisheries suffers dramatically with Salvinia plants blocking nets and impeding the passage of boats (Agriculture & Resource Management Council of Australia & New Zealand et al. 2003; CRC 2003). Dense mats of Salvinia can be mistaken for solid ground by people and animals with reported instances of animals falling into the water body beneath. The dense mats impede water flow, restrict stock access and provide favourable conditions for the breeding of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Salvinia can clog pump intakes and cause water losses from storage areas by increasing levels of evapo-transpiration (increased water evaporating from the plant leaves).\n\nNative ecosystems: Salvinia forms dense mats over the water surface, severely modifying aquatic habitat, shading out and creating unfavourable conditions for all aquatic organisms of flora and fauna, including birds, fish, invertebrates and other aquatic animals and aquatic plants. Light is excluded and oxygen levels are reduced leading to water stagnation and pollution. Decaying plant material can produce foul odours.",
    "controlMethods": "Successful management is achieved when control methods are combined (an integrated control method) in order to put greater pressure on the weed, or to treat the weed.\n\nChemical control: Salvinia can be sprayed with various herbicides including Diqaut, glyphosate, and Carfentrazone-ethyl. Results can be variable as upper leaf surfaces are largely non-wettable making absorption of herbicides difficult (Muyt 2001). There are no situations where a single application of herbicide will provide ongoing control of Salvinia. Initial treatments will always need to be followed up with further treatments. The correct application and timing is important and may vary across Australia.\n\nWarning: Herbicide use in and around water may require a licence and each State and Territory has regulations for the use of herbicides in and near waterways. Please check with your relevant government department and always check the product label information for safety information to people and wildlife and for irrigation water withholding periods. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Manual (hand) removal plant can be removed by hand from small ponds but every plant needs to be removed as vegetative growth will occur plants will multiply eventually covering the pond. Large infestations are sometimes gathered with mechanical harvesters and scoops, although the effectiveness of this method is limited by the ease with which the plants break into fragments (Muyt 2001).\n\nBooms and containment fences: Containing infestations with booms or meshed containment fences should be used to prevent further spread and keep intake or other areas free of Salvinia. Containment is important for infestations, where an infestation has the ability to spread and invade new areas;  keeping certain areas Salvinia free; contain sections of Salvinia in one area to minimise costs and the time required to carry out herbicide treatments or physical removal; separate areas for different control treatments (i.e. different herbicides, herbicide and biological control, mechanical removal, and biological control. it is important to Identify the source of the infestation  to avoid further spread and re-infestation.\n\nManagement: Salvinia grows faster and produces more growth the higher the nutrient levels in a water body. Reducing  the growth and biomass of Salvina involves reducing nutrient levels in waterways. This can be achieved by  managing erosion on cultivated land, controlling stock access to banks, diverting effluent before it enters the waterway, and not washing waste from cattle yards or dairies into waterways (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nDisposal: Small infestations in home ponds and aquaria can be gathered with fine-woven scoops, placed in sealed plastic bags and destroyed by leaving the bags in a warm, sunny place for a few days (Muyt 2001). Plants deposited on the banks of water-bodies can be moved away from the water’s edge, and preferably burnt, to prevent reintroduction (Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Water 2006).\n\nBiological control: Salvinia has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. The Salvinia Weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) has undergone CSIRO research and has been released in Australia as a biological control agent. Although effective in tropical areas it has little impact in more temperate climates (Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Water 2006). The Salvinia weevil is a small, black insect which grows to about 2 mm long. Adult weevils feed on the growing tips, suppressing growth. Larvae tunnel through the horizontal stems, particularly in younger parts of the plant causing the weed to break apart, sink and decompose on the bottom of the waterway.  The Salvinia weevil does most damage when Salvinia is healthy and green and the temperature is around 30°C. Weevils breed very slowly at temperatures less than 20 °C and ceases breeding below about 17 °C.  The best time to introduce the weevil is early spring as the warmer weather helps populations establish (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nFor further information on all control methods see the Salvinia Control Manual (Oosterhout 2006) and the NSW Weedwise website (DPI NSW 2019).",

It is common on floodplains in grey cracking clays. It is a weed of cultivation, run-down pastures, roadsides and waste places (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Conn 1992; Cunningham et al. 1992; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Mintweed is a rapid coloniser of disturbed soils. It can invade pastures that have been stressed by overgrazing, frequent summer flooding or cultivation and replace valued pasture species. It may also compete with and reduce the yields of winter cereals, sorghum, maize and cotton. Although not usually a serious weed of wheat crops, its seed will still contaminate the wheat grain. Its seedlings are only weakly competitive and rarely invade vigorous established pastures. However, Mintweed does invade and compete very effectively with winter growing Phalaris aquatica pastures. Dry winters followed by wet summers provide optimal conditions for an explosive spread of the weed in disturbed pastures, where it can quickly take over. Rain also liberates allelopathic substances (chemical inhibitors) from minute bladder-like structures (glands) on the leaves, which have adverse effects on the germination and growth of seedlings of crop and pasture species (Cunningham et al. 1992; Felfoldi 1993; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nMintweed seed can contaminate pasture seed and is often found in seed of millet, sorghum, panic, lucerne, Vigna, Rhodes Grass, Phalaris, Buffel Grass, oats and Urochloa (Friend 1983).\n\nMintweed can be toxic to stock. It may be eaten by hungry stock and has been reported to have caused fatal nitrate poisoning in sheep and cattle. It is particularly a hazard when hungry animals are introduced for the first time to densely infested pastures or, in winter, when dried plant material has lost much of the strong odour and flavour that previously deterred grazing. There is a risk to animals when travelling along infested stock routes and contaminated cereal hay has caused poisoning (Hurst 1942; Everist 1974; Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Cunningham et al. 1992; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Mintweed will also taint milk (Friend 1983).",

In native pastures, light grazing and topdressing increase pasture vigour and help suppress Mintweed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Herbicides are an effective control measure. However, it is necessary to re-apply sprays each time new seedlings emerge and to prevent stock access to sprayed pastures (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "reproduction": "",
    "habitat": "Willows occur naturally in permanently or seasonally wet, inundated or waterlogged sites (CRC 2003). In Australia they are mainly found in similar situations along water courses or in seasonal or permanently wet areas.",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Most species of Willow are Weeds of National Significance. They are among the worst weeds in Australia because of their invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. They have invaded riverbanks and wetlands in temperate Australia, occupying thousands of kilometres of streams and numerous wetland areas (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: Willow thickets can restrict access to waterway impacting livestock.\n\nWater use: The amount of water willows use when located in the stream bed is substantially higher than native trees, which is damaging for water availability and water quality (CRC 2003). Field research in the Murray-Darling Basin has indicated that in cool temperate climates an average net water saving of 3.9ML a year could be achieved for each hectare of willow canopy removed, and in semi-arid climates this could be as high as an average of 5.5 ML (Doody and Benyon 2011).\n\nNative ecosystems: Willows spread their roots into the bed of a watercourse, slowing the flow of water and reducing aeration. Willows form thickets which divert water outside the main watercourse or channel, causing flooding, instability and erosion where the creek banks are vulnerable, as they can grow into water courses, changing ecosystems. As Willows are winter deciduous (all leaves fall from the tree for winter), the leaves fall into in water courses. This creates a flush of organic matter reducing water quality and available oxygen, directly threatening aquatic plants and animals. The replacement of native vegetation (e.g. river red gums) by willows reduces habitat (e.g. nesting hollows, snags) for both land and aquatic animals (CRC 2003). Willows have only invaded about 5% of their potential geographic range in temperate Australia (CRC 2003).\n\nUrban areas: Willows form dense impenetrable thickets and reduce or eliminate visual and physical access to water bodies. Willows form dense root mats and produce dense stems that block access for boats, canoes and rafts used for fishing and other aquatic activities. The spreading nature of Willows on waterways can also damage infrastructure.",
    "controlMethods": "Early detection and control are essential to prevent the spread of new infestations. The deliberate planting of willows along waterways has virtually ceased and extensive removal operations are common. Willows are relatively easy to kill and mechanical and chemical control techniques are well understood. However, it should be noted that indiscriminate removal of willows is not recommended as it may lead to stream instability. Control should be conducted in consultation with state or territory authorities (CRC 2003). See Holland and Davies (2007) for managing Willows and the variety of control options available.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides available for woody weeds are effective in controlling Willow. Trees can be killed by stem injection, application to leaves and stems, bark (chemical girdling) and cut and paint methods (check with state/territory agencies for current recommendations). In dry conditions herbicide can also be applied by basal bark spraying and treatment of seedlings. Although stem injection may be a slower, more laborious method, it is an important option for avoiding chemical runoff and protecting native vegetation. In general, herbicide should be applied from summer to early autumn, although stem injection or cut and paint application is effective year round (CRC 2003). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: The value of physical controls (hand-pulling  or manual) is limited to small and isolated situations and could be particularly useful in removing initial invaders of a catchment if they can be located early enough. Elimination of young seedlings is a cost effective way of keeping waterways free of potential blockages, erosion and stream bed change. Hand pulling of seedlings less than 0.5 m tall is the most practical and environmentally safe way of removing young plants. Leaving small roots in the ground does not lead to suckering or regrowth (CRC 2003). Mechanical control: Using large machinery such as excavators or bulldozers to remove larger trees and root systems is not recommended except in dry areas. In wet areas bulldozers push broken branches into the ground and thus generate numerous new plants (CRC 2003).\n\nDisposal: Trees killed while they are standing (i.e. by stem injection) should be left for 12 months before they are removed. They can then be cut at a suitable height and stacked away from watercourses. If it is necessary to remove live trunks and limbs from the site, stack them to dry above flood level, taking care to minimise the spread of small pieces. Smaller twigs should be bagged and disposed of at tip facilities so that they do not sprout and cause further problems (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Willow Sawfly (Nematus oligospilus) had accidentally arrived in Australia and was first reported in Canberra in 2004 and by April 2006 it had arrived in the ACT, NSW, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. Larvae of this insect feed on Willow leaves and large populations of sawfly larvae can defoliate Willow trees. However, Willow Sawfly has not had a great impact on control of Willows.",
    "origin": "All willows in Australia have been introduced from other countries, with most probably coming from Europe. Most species presently growing in Australia are found naturally in Great Britain and Ireland (Meikle 1984).",
    "growthForm": "Tree or shrub",
    "similarSpecies": "The Willows may be confused with the Poplars (Populus spp.), another introduced group which has been planted widely in Australia and has also become weedy in parts. Poplars normally have broader, glossy leaves and longer, dangling catkins. They are more often found planted away from rivers. Willows are unlikely to be confused with any Australian native species.",

    "impact": "Sacciolepis interrupta has been targeted as a potential environmental weed by the Northern Australia Quarantine Service. This is due to its proliferation in habitats that are similar, and close in proximity, to northern Australia (Waterhouse & Mitchell 1998).\n\nAgriculture: The spongy culms of Sacciolepis interrupta provide succulent fodder for buffalo and cattle (Lazarides 1980). The grain of S. interrupta is known to be collected and used as a food source in central Chad (Freedman 1998) and possibly in Nigeria, although it is unclear whether the grain used here is S. interrupta or S. africana (Burkhill 1985).\n\nS. interrupta is a common weed of rice-fields in Indonesia and Assam in India (Islam et al. 2004; Soerjani et al. 1987) and it is a major weed of transplanted lowland rice. With no control at all, weeds may reduce rice yields by 15–40% (Islam et al. 2004). In Indonesia, S. interrupta is a weed of deep water rice. These rice fields are under 60–120 cm of water for 6–7 months of the year (Soerjani et al. 1987).\n\nHuman impact: In India, S. interrupta growing in rice fields and fallow areas has been shown to be a host plant for the breeding of the three species of the mosquito Mansonia, which provide a vector for the round worm, Brugia malayi (Krishnamoorthy et al. 2007). This parasite causes serious disease in humans (Filarial Biology and Pathology undated).",

S.indica and S. myosuroides are native to Australia and Asia (Sharp & Simon 2002).\n\nIn its native habitat, it often found mixed with Hymenachne acutigluma from which it may be distinguished by its hollow stem, short inflorescence and branches, and long upper glume (modified leaf below the spikelet) (Soerjani et al. 1987). H. acutigluma is a native of India and South East Asia, also occurring along the coast of the Northern Territory and northern Queensland (AVH 2008; Gilliland et al. 1971).\n\nSacciolepis interrupta extends into eastern Africa where it resembles S. africana except for its larger pointed spikelets. However, the division between the two species is not clear-cut, and there is some overlap in individual characters (Burkhill 1985; Clayton 1989).",

It occurs from the coast to mountains and inland areas on more fertile soils. It has a wide climatic range from cool temperate to subtropical regions (Page & Lacey 2006). It has become naturalised in natural habitats such as open forests (Kodela 2007, pers. comm.).",

    "impact": "Curled Dock is an agricultural and environmental weed. It has a large crown and dense leaf growth that crowds out more desirable species, and it can grow in a wide range of environments. It is a prolific seeder, generating about 60 000 seeds per plant (Page & Lacey 2006). It is an aggressive coloniser, shading out other plants and depleting soil nutrients and moisture through its extensive root system, which can reach 3 m in depth and can become the dominant herbaceous plant, particularly in irrigated production areas (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Forestry Tasmania 1999, DPIW 2007, Kodela & Wilson 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nAgriculture: Dense stands of Curled Dock can obstruct irrigation and drainage channels, reduce grazing capacity and cause yield losses in pasture. It can degenerate lucerne crops, infest irrigated orchards and other plantation crops and its seedlings compete with crop plants (Forestry Tasmania 1999, DPIW 2007, Kodela & Wilson 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nIt contains oxalates and is suspected of poisoning stock. However, levels are unlikely to be high enough to kill and it is generally considered to be unpalatable to stock (Everist 1981).\n\nNative ecosystem: Infestations compete for space, light, moisture and nutrients to replace native species in natural wetland, riverbank and other plant communities (Kodela & Wilson 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Single plants of Curled Dock can be controlled by deep hoeing or grubbing. For larger infestations, a combination of cultivation and herbicides is effective. Slashing and mowing are not effective.\n\nChemical control: In pastures, infestation can be reduced by the spray/graze technique (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nBiological control: Curled Dock has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process.

The docks biocontrol program which ran from 1982 to 1998 targeted Swamp Dock (R. brownii), Curled Dock (R. crispus), Broadleaf Dock (R. obtusifolius) and Fiddle Dock (R. pulcher). The program resulted in the release of one agent, the Clearwing Moth Pyropteron doryliformis, which has become widely established and provides almost total control in Western Australia and good control in approximately 50% of infested areas in Victoria and New South Wales (Page & Lacey 2006).\n\nFor further information on management and control of Curled Dock see Forestry Tasmania (1999) and the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water (2007).",

Sorrel (Acetosella vulgaris) [as R. acetosella] also has untoothed valves and upright branches, but is a much shorter, slender rhizomatous plant (Wilson 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nCurled Dock hybridises with Broadleaf Dock.

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "European Blackberries (Rubus fruticosus aggregate) is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts in cool to warm temperate to sub-tropical areas. European Blackberries can infest large areas quickly as they are vigorous growing plants with many plants able to germinate and vegetatively root covering larges areas. European Blackberries currently  infests about 9 million hectares of land in Australia. Thickets can pose a fire hazard because of the dry material contained within them. Larger animals may become trapped in the prickly thickets while smaller animals, native and feral rabbits and foxes use these thickets as shelter, and it also provides food for introduced species such as starlings, blackbirds, and foxes that subsequently spread of the species new new areas. Control costs are high and a sustained effort is needed to attain success (CRC 2003).\n\nHowever on the positive side, Blackberry plants are also used for fruit and honey production.\n\nAgriculture: Does not effect well managed farmland, but can established in paddocks as it is generally unpalatable to most livestock, eventually taking over forming large impenetrable thickets, and blocks access to waterways. Can also form thickets in orchards and forestry that restrict movement of people and machinery, reducing productivity and increasing control costs.\n\nNative ecosystems:  Blackberry forms impenetrable prickly thickets and mounds that fill gullies and hillsides, smoother native shrub layers and ground vegetation, and prevents germination of trees and shrubs preventing succession. These thickets can also reduce the natural attraction of the bush as well as hindering recreational opportunities by preventing access to natural features.\n\nUrban areas: Urban areas may also be affected, with blackberry occupying abandoned land and colonising roadside vegetation. Due to the prickles it is avoided by people as tough prickles it can tear and damage clothes and skin alike.",
    "controlMethods": "There are a number of options for control of European Blackberry and these include physical and mechanical control, fire burning, grazing, and chemical methods. Biological control research has been carried out but has proved ineffective  but whichever program is adopted it will need to be planned and sustained over a number of years to control infestations and prevent re-invasion.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides are the most reliable blackberry control method and should be used with other control methods. However, while several herbicides are recommended for managing Rubus species, different blackberry species react differently to herbicides. There are many herbicides registered for use on blackberry. A mixture of triclopyr + picloram used with or without aminopyralid gives the best long-term control. (DPI NSW 2019). Spray healthy, actively growing plants with new leaves on the cane tips and apply to both the outer and inner leaves with the first year plants are easier to kill. (DPI NSW 2019). Well-established thickets may need more treatments like slashing or burning to access and promote fresh new growth that affectively adsorbs herbicide. The regrowth of plants that have attained up to 1 m can then be sprayed with herbicide (DPI NSW 2019). See the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical control either by manual (hand) or mechanical (machine) means removes biomass, but alone is rarely successful because it’s hard to remove all the roots and is normally used with a follow-up herbicide.\n\nGrazing: Goats can make a start on controlling heavy infestations and prefer blackberry over improved pasture species. Sheep and cattle may graze blackberry seedlings if there is no other palatable feed around also stopping young daughter plants from establishing. Again flow-up with herbicide will kill plants.\n\nFire: Fire will not kill blackberry infestations but is  used to reduce biomass allowing access areas and subsequent to new growth for follow-up herbicide treatment.\n\nBiological control: Blackberry was recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process and rust was researched as and agent, although it has has largely been ineffective across the range. Beer & Morin (2005) stated that Biological control (eg the rust fungus) is particularly useful in large inaccessible areas (Beer & Morin 2005). However, the rust fungus is not used in South Australia and the rusts is now found naturally on plants with little apparent impact.",
    "origin": "European Blackberry is a native of Europe where there are hundreds of microspecies recognised. Recent work (Evans et al. 2007) has matched Australian species with at least 15 European species but there is still further work needed to decide whether the Australian species have a similar genetic content to their European counterparts or whether they have evolved further in Australia (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "growthForm": "Shrub",
    "similarSpecies": "Other Blackberry species are present in Australia but they can usually be distinguished because they have pinnately (opposite) inserted leaflets rather than palmately arranged (like a hand) leaflets.\n\nThe native Australian species, Rubus parvifolius, occurs in the same habitats and is often mixed with Blackberry. It has been removed in the mistaken belief that it was a weed. Other native Rubus species in the eastern states are less likely to be confused with the aggregate.\n\nBlackberry may be confused with some introduced American species previously, or still, used for fruit production (such as Rubus laudatus, Rubus loganobaccus (Loganberry), Rubus roribaccus (Dewberry) and Rubus philadelphicus (Lawton berry)). It may also be confused with the introduced Asian species Rubus alceifolius (Giant Bramble), a pest in Queensland (Land Protection 2006) and Rubus ellipticus (Yellowberry), invasive and naturalised in Queensland and New South Wales. Rubus phoenicolasius (Wineberry) is not yet recorded as naturalised in Australia but it has been seen as an aggressive garden plant.\n\nBefore flowering it is possible to confuse some of the rose species which have naturalised in Australia with Blackberry since they both form rounded clumps along roadsides. Roses have pinnately compound leaves and a stipule attached at the base of the leaf, absent in Blackberry.\n\nDifferences between all of these species can be found in an interactive key to all Rubus species found in Australia (Barker & Barker 2005).",

It is most common in cooler regions of higher rainfall, but will also grow in the moist gullies and protected areas of drier areas.

Sweet Briar can compete with neighbouring pasture plants, significantly reducing productivity. Young plants and suckers can be suppressed by rabbit and stock grazing but mature woody plants are highly unpalatable to stock and reduce the presence and productivity of desirable pasture species through competition. Its prickly nature can also restrict stock movement and access to water, and deter grazing close to clumps. The dense patches can harbour pest species such as rabbits (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) and it is also a potential biosecurity risk from their ability to host fruit fly.  It is also a pest plant of pine plantations and roadsides.\n\nNative ecosystems: Sweet Briar invades a wide variety of areas including lowland grassland, grassy woodland, sclerophyll forests, riparian habitats, alpine and sub-alpine vegetation, pastures and pine plantations (Blood 2001). Heavy infestations typically occur in hilly or rocky areas near trees, creek banks, or fence lines (Clements et al. 2005). Commonly seen growing along native roadside corridors out-competing native plants.  Although the seedlings have a low survival rate, once established, plants may be highly competitive (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).

Established plants can be removed by hand, grubbing, bulldozing, or tractor, and their removal is more effective when the ground is wet (Clements et al. 2005). The crown of larger plants should be fully removed to prevent regrowth, and fruits should be disposed of safely (Muyt 2001). Deep cultivation can also be effective on arable land, and will expose and kill much of the root system, but follow-up cultivation in summer will be necessary to eradicate any remaining roots, and in autumn to prevent seedling growth (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Cultivation can, however, be problematic if plants are large and well established (Clements et al. 2005). Goats and sheep can be used to control larger infestation, and goats can destroy larger plants over time (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Goats are known to provide continuous pressure to the plants that they have a tendency to prefer over many pasture species. An advantage of using goats to control both species is that they can also provide a cash return.\n\nChemical control: Larger plants can be treated with herbicide with a cut-and-paint method, preferably before the fruits ripen in summer and autumn.  Techniques such as ‘cut and paint’ are useful for small numbers of plants. Follow-up treatments may be necessary to prevent regrowth. Alternatively, larger infestations may be foliar sprayed with non-selective or selective herbicides, applied near to the flowering period, and when the plant is actively growing. Selective herbicides appear to be more effective. Cleared sites should always be monitored regularly and any regrowth controlled with follow-up herbicide treatment (Muyt 2001).

It is considered a threat to all cropping, all grazing and all horticulture in Australia. Based on the modelling, Creeping Yellowcress has the potential to invade more than 650 000 km2 of agricultural land, putting at risk millions of dollars in revenue (Cunningham et al. 2004; Cunningham et al. 2006; Tasmanian Land and Water Professionals undated).\n\nIt is contains hirsutin in its roots, which inhibits germination and growth of some crops (Yamane et al. 1992).\n\nIt is tolerant to both drought and immersion. It has been reported as being a troublesome and persistent weed of nurseries and other horticultural enterprises in Tasmania, where it can have significant impacts on productivity. In the Netherlands it is a common weed of ornamental bulb production areas, where it reduces bulb crop value and marketability as a contaminant of nursery stock. It is also considered a serious agricultural and horticultural weed in the United States where it infests orchards and nurseries (Tasmanian Land and Water Professionals undated).\n\nIn New Zealand's south island, it is locally common, in gardens, market gardens, cultivated and swampy land, riverbeds and damp pasture. There it can form dense mats which can completely smother pasture (Webb et al. 1988; Dow AgroSciences undated).\n\nNative ecosystems: In the United States and in New Zealand it invades riparian ecosystems, such as streams and wetlands (Tasmanian Land and Water Professionals undated).",

If you think that you have found Creeping Yellowcress then you should first contract the biosecurity agency in your state.\n\nChemical control: It has been difficult to manage with herbicides, but herbicide application remains the main practical means of control. Best results are achieved by applying the herbicide just prior to flowering. Due to the capacity for regeneration from rhizomes follow-up spraying will be required to kill any re-shooting plants and any seedlings (Tasmanian Land and Water Professional undated).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual control: During any removal by hand, it is important to collect all pieces of rhizomes, as new plants can form from detached rhizomes. As such, machinery shouldn't be used for removal. It is important to avoid transferring plant matter through cultivation and to ensure that all equipment is thoroughly cleaned after being used in contaminated areas (Dow AgroSciences undated, Tasmanian Land and Water Professional undated).",

Cultivation is seldom useful as a control method and in fact may assist their dispersal by breaking up and distributing the corm. Limited success may be obtained where the corms can be brought to the soil surface to dry out in summer (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated).\n\nChemical control: Spot spraying is recommended, with a registered herbicide, just on flowering time when corm exhaustion occurs (Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nThese control methods are also likely to be effective on other Romulea species.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority at for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

It occurs in gardens and and sucker throughout and under fences roadsides in country and urban areas.\n\nPrefers full sun and well drained soils and invades dry and sandy sites, ex-pasture, disturbed forest, disturbed shrubland, forest edges, plantation forest and roadsides.",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) can produce a large amount of root suckers to form quite dense thickets or copses that exclude native and other vegetation (DPI NSW (2019; Weiseler 2008). Black Locust has become a locally serious weed in Europe and in the united States of America outside of its natural range. In parts of Germany it has been responsible for the conversion of grassland into woodland (Thorp, J.R. & Wilson, M. 1998). Suckering dense clumps are all interconnected and further disturbance encourages further dense suckering.\n\nAgriculture: Suckering plants can invade open paddocks, reducing carrying capacity. In addition, all parts of the plant including the leaves, wood, roots, pods and seeds are toxic to stock (Blood 2001). Black Locust is also fatal to horses and in one case a woman gave her horses some Robinia pseudoacacia to graze on. Within two hours both horses were in distress, shaking, frothing at the mouth and in much pain. The vet was able to save one of the horses, with the older horse  put down after hours of agony. The owner was previously unaware that the plant was poisonous (Thomson 2007). Horses feeding on Robinia pseudoacacia bark died after 4 hours (Wink & Van Wyk, 2008)\n\nNative ecosystems:  In Victoria, it has invaded lowland grassland and grassy woodlands, as well as riparian vegetation (Carr et al. 1992). Will invade grassy open areas, and suckers can invade edge of open woodlands, and vegetation on roadsides .\n\nUrban areas:  Individual trees can grow without suckering long into maturity, and do not sucker. Suckering occurs when roots are disturbed, or the tree is cut down, then prolific suckering can occur.\n\nBlack locust is toxic to humans (Blood 2001) and can cause discomfort and irritation, but is reported as not life-threatening (DPI NSW 2019). All parts of the plant are poisonous, especially the pods, seeds, bark and leaves. It can cause dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions and drowsiness.\n\nWhat to do if poisoning occurs:\n\nIf the patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nIf the patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",
    "controlMethods": "Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a suckering tree, re-sprouting from underground roots. Disturbance of roots or removal of tree normally results in dense suckering clumps. Unless the near impossible task of removing all roots, suckering will ocurr. After above ground control the only feasible means of control is l Chemical, with follow-up control required.\n\nChemical control: Wieseler (2008) reports control by applying 15:1 water-glyphosate solution to cut stems and stumps, although follow-up applications may be required. More effective control may be achieved by applying a 25% triclopyr solution in basal oil (3:1 oil:triclopyr) applied immediately to cut stumps (Wieseler 2008).  Standard chemical control techniques for woody weeds (e.g. 'drill and fill' or 'frill and fill' as outlined in Muyt 2001) are likely to be effective. More effective control may be achieved by applying a 25% triclopyr solution in basal oil (3:1 oil:triclopyr) applied immediately to cut stumps (Wieseler 2008).\n\nFor summary on herbicide use, see: (Brown & Bettink 2009-; DiTomaso & Kyser et al. 2013; DPI NSW 2019; Wieseler 2008). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-Chemical control: Seedling rarely occur, but where young seedlings appear, seedling with tap root can be physically removed. Larger trees that are cut down will sucker, and removal of suckers will be ongoing.  Chemical long term control may be the only way to successful treat Black Locust, preventing ongoing sucking.",

    "similarSpecies": "In Australia, Black Locust is most likely to be confused with Honey Locust (Gleditsia triacanthos) which is a widely grown ornamental and a common street tree. It differs from Black Locust in having more leaflets (normally more than 25) per leaf, each of which is obscurely toothed along the leaf edge. Like Black Locust, Honey Locust also has spines, but these are produced separately from the leaves and not in pairs whereas in Black Locust the spines are paired at the leaf-bases (however in both species, spines are not always present). The flowers of Honey Locust are quite different from Black Locust, not pea-like, but very tiny and yellowish, with 8 segments (4 petals; 4 sepals, or modified leaves) of more or less equal size and shape produced in spikes 5-10 cm long. Golden Locust is also naturalised to some extent in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria (AVH 2020; Wiecek 1991).",

    "impact": "Castor oil plant is is poisonous to people and animals.  It also invades pastures, reducing productivity.  It can out compete native plants and reduces habitat and food for native animals.\n\nAgriculture: The plant is unpalatable and is rarely grazed by stock. This can lead to the plant invading pastures especially those on alluvial soils and cause a significant loss of prime grazing land (Wilson 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Castor oil plant is poisonous to dogs and livestock including cattle, horses, pigs, sheep and poultry. Livestock rarely eat this weed due to the odour of the leaves. However, poisoning can occur if grain is contaminated with seeds. Symptoms are similar to human poisoning. It may take a few hours or days for symptoms to appear. Honey bees have been poisoned by castor oil plants (NSW 2019). The seeds of Castor Oil Plant are extremely poisonous to humans and livestock (Wilson 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems: common also waterways in open areas and wherever there is disturbance. If left untreated, Castor Oil Plant will grow to form dense stands along river banks and can grow to large sizes, outcompeting with native plants.\n\nHuman poisonings: Castor oil plant contains a toxin called ricin. It is toxic to humans, capable of causing serious illness and death. Flowers, leaves and especially the seeds are poisonous. Eating castor oil plant causes, a burning sensation in the throat and mouth, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and bleeding, bleeding from the eye and mucous membranes, respiratory and cardiac distress and failure. Temporary blindness may occur if the sap gets into the eyes. Touching leaves and seeds can cause dermatitis in people with sensitive skin.\n\nWhat to do if a person is poisoned:\n\nIf the patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nIf the patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",
    "controlMethods": "Castor oil plant can be controlled by hand pulling or digging out seedlings and young plants, and slashing, mowing and cultivation, herbicides. Follow up any control work is required to treat plants that have re-grown or stop new plants from growing and seeding, with site checks needed for 4–5 years. Be careful when controlling this plant as it is poisonous. Wear protective clothing including gloves and eye protection before starting control work.\n\nNon-chemical control: Individual plants of Castor Oil Plant can be removed by cultivation, digging or hand pulling (Wilson 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Big Scrub Rainforest Landcare Group 2000). Young plants can be hand pulled or dug out quite easily. Larger plants can be removed if the soil is damp. It is important to remove as much of the roots as possible to stop the plant from re-growing. Large areas of castor oil plant can be slashed or mown, followed by cultivation. Keep cultivation shallow to stop seeds from being buried deeply. Deeper burial can cause dormancy in seeds and this could make control difficult in future. Check the area and control any regrowth or new seedlings (NSW DPI 2019).\n\nChemical control: Large individual plants can be cut and the stumps immediately painted with an appropriate herbicide (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Larger infestations may require foliar spraying with herbicides (Wilson 1989). Alternatively, application of an appropriate herbicide by soil injection. Castor Oil Plant is susceptible to several herbicides and spraying actively growing plants gives good control (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Cut trunks or stems and apply herbicide within 15 seconds.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "habitat": "Creeping Knapweed (Rhaponticum repens) grows in semi-arid to sub-humid temperate regions, usually in clay or clay loam soils but not restricted to any particular soil type. It is an aggressive weed of cultivation, especially irrigated horticultural crops (such as vines and orchards) and dryland cereals (mainly in the 300-600 mm annual rainfall belt), as well as occurring in pastures, often in moist sites, along roadsides, channel banks in irrigated pastures, waste areas or other disturbed sites (Lamp & Collet 1989; Murray 1992; McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Richardson et al. 2006; Victorian Department of Primary Industries 2007). They can tolerate all soil types and drought conditions for many years because of the longevity of their extensive root system (Agriculture Victoria 2021).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Creeping Knapweed (Rhaponticum repens) has an extensive, fast-growing root system enabling rapid spread, plant hardiness and the ability of dense patches of Creeping Knapweed to smother and exclude other species, thus making it a very competitive agricultural weed (Pritchard 1992; McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Prolonged contact with Creeping Knapweed may cause skin sensitisation and dermatitis in humans (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998).\n\nAgriculture: Creeping Knapweed spreads aggressively and can render agricultural land and rangeland useless in a relatively short space of time (van Rangelrooy 1993).  In Victoria, Creeping Knapweed is recognised as one of the most competitive of all weeds (Agriculture Victoria 2021). However, in South Australia it does not normally dominate pastures, spreading slowly within a paddock and taking up to 20 years to become dominant after its introduction (Government of South Australia 2021). Once dominant they can virtually exclude all other vegetation and reduce yield in dry land cropping by as much as 80 per cent. Initially a common weed of irrigated vines, fruit and other crops (e.g. along the Murray River from Swan Hill to Merbein), it has become a serious competitor of cereal crops and dryland pastures in north-western Victoria, e.g. in dryland cropping in the Swan Hill-Kerang area of the Victorian Mallee, where it can form dense patches to the virtual exclusion of other vegetation and reduce the yield of cereal crops by as much as 75% or more (Pritchard 1992; McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nDue to its root system which can extend to 5 metres deep, once established it relies on subsoil moisture and can live and dominate in lower winter-rainfall climates. It can take advantage of the lack of competition in summer fallows, as its rate of growth is proportional to light intensity. Due to its deeper and more efficient root system, in dry years a heavy infestations can kill the cereal crop by water stress (Government of South Australia 2021) and heavily infested paddocks are sometimes no longer able to be cropped (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nAs a major competitive weed of cereal crops, it can cause heavy yield losses and resulting economic impacts (Pritchard 1992). In summer its active growth can completely suppress the growth of other crops such as Sudan Grass and Sorghum (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977). It forms dense patches shading out crops and pastures, as well as being a vigorous and efficient competitor for water and nutrients (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Lloyd 2006). However, it's growth rate declines under shading and it does not compete well under a heavy canopy, and is weakened by dense shade (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nIt impacts on the productivity of pastures, and has little feed value. The leaves, although having a bitter disagreeable taste, are still grazed by sheep (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001), but may be poisonous and kill sheep if eaten in large amounts (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Lloyd 2006). Overseas claims of Creeping Knapweed being poisonous to livestock and causing a neurological disorder in horses (which can result in death by starvation) have not been reported in Australia (van Rangelrooy 1993; McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nIt has allelopathic properties (releases chemicals) that restrict growth of other species such as oats, beans and tomatoes, which might contribute to it occurring in almost pure Creeping Knapweed stands (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Seed is occasionally found in oats, linseed and canary seed (Friend 1983). The seeds are bitter and impart an unpleasant taste to flour made from contaminated grain (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Primarily an agricultural weed, grows on the edge of open or degraded, disturbed native vegetation.\n\nUrban areas: Mainly a weed of agriculture and disturbance e.g. by cultivation, erosion or earth movement, it may grow by roadsides and sheds and yards, abandoned areas where it may have been spread by machinery and vehicles.",
    "controlMethods": "Creeping Knapweed (Rhaponticum repens) extensive perennial root system resists control efforts (Pritchard 1992). Once established this weed is difficult to control (especially in crops) and eradicate (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Lloyd 2006). Observing equipment hygiene protocols is extremely important to avoid spread of propagules to new areas or clean properties (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998). Successful weed control requires follow up after the initial efforts. This means looking for and killing regrowth or new seedlings. Using a combination of control methods is usually more successful.\n\nChemical control: Creeping Knapweed can often be effectively chemically controlled by using various herbicides (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Laufenberg et al. 2005; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food, undated). Early detection and eradication of small patches using herbicides and follow-up treatments is recommended (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998).  Small incursions on a property can be destroyed by prompt spot spraying. Please see DPI NSW (2019); Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018); the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  Young seedling can be chipped out removing roots, however, only used for new and small infestations.\n\nMechanical control:  It may be possible to eliminate Creeping Knapweed through repeated cultivation over several years, but it must be carried out at intervals of no more than 3 weeks during the growing season. However, this will seldom be practical and may actually spread the weed rather than weaken infestations. This method of mechanical control is best avoided in pasture and broadacre cropping situations. Repeated deep cultivation is, however, used for control in vineyards and orchards but can still result in pieces of root being moved to clean areas. In areas where lucerne, clover or perennial pastures can be grown, Creeping Knapweed is controlled by competition and regular cutting or grazing (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\nCompetition and management: The most effective control is to prevent the introduction and spread of the species. This is assisted by advice and legislative declarations of weed status. Western Australia and the Northern Territory similarly prohibit the introduction and movement of plants or seed, and the eradication of any infestations that might be found (van Rangelrooy 1993; Lloyd 2006; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food, undated).",

White Weeping Broom is possibly the most drought tolerant of the exotic brooms in Australia, making it a particular threat in dry regions and during drought years DPI NSW (2019).\n\nAgriculture: White Weeping Broom has the potential to become a significant threat to Australia's pastoral industry if it escapes containment (CRC 2003).

It is also probably the least palatable to stock of the exotic brooms DPI NSW (2019), but if eaten, all domestic species are susceptible to intoxication which can kill (Bahri et al, 1999).\n\nNative ecosystems:  White Weeping Broom is a potentially serious invader of natural vegetation (CRC 2003).\n\nUrban areas:  White Weeping Broom also has the potential to invade vegetation around communities especially small coastal communities and to spread  throughout such areas via roadsides",
    "controlMethods": "White Weeping Broom (Retama raetam) is is not widespread in Australia and the preferred method of control has not yet been fully developed. However, experience in controlling other WoNS brooms including Cytisus scoparius, which is a major weed in southern Australia, could be applied to White Weeping Broom (Office of Environment and Heritage. 2014). Any control of White Weeping Broom should be undertaken cooperatively with your state or territory weed management agency or local council (CRC 2003). Once an area of White Weeping Broom has been treated, it will be necessary to monitor the treated area for many years and destroy new plants (CRC 2003; DPI NSW 2019).\n\nChemical control: No herbicides are registered for control of White Weeping Broom. In the case of Cytisus scoparius, chemical control is effective in the short term but is expensive and needs to be followed up for many years until the seedbank has been depleted. There is also a risk of damage to non-target species. Some useful herbicide control methods for the WoNS brooms can be seen in Office of Environment and Heritage (2014)  and DPI NSW (2019). Please follow your States or Territories guidelines, contacting relevant authorities if you are unclear, and follow herbicide label information before proceeding.  Herbicide application methods for other weedy brooms include:\n\nFoliar spraying: For the application of herbicide solution to weed foliage in the form of a spray, a common method used for woody plants. Foliar spraying can be used to treat plants of all ages but can be less effective on older plants.\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface killing the plant to prevent regeneration from the rootstock.\n\nBasal barking: This method involves applying herbicide mixed with an adjuant to the lower trunk or stem of woody plants up to around 50 mm in diameter to a height of 30-40 cm above ground level.\n\nStem injection (drill-and-fill): Stem injection delivers herbicide directly to the sapwood but is rarely used on brooms, but when used, it is for plants with stems over 50 mm in circumference.\n\nScrape-and-paint: This method involves scraping away a small section of the bark and applying herbicide directly onto the sapwood. It is an effective but rarely used technique normally used on larger plants.\n\nSplatter or gas gun:  splatter guns were developed over thirty five years ago for sheep drenching and has been adapted for weed spraying using chemicals.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical removal is an option for isolated plants, especially if they have not seeded; although seedlings are hard to hand pull, tools can be used making removal easier. However, it will be necessary to monitor the treated area for many years and destroy any new plants that germinate from the soil seed bank.\n\nMechanical control: Bulldozing infestations into heaps and burning the resulting weed mounds has been a common method used to control Broom but it only provides a temporary solution. Bulldozing causes massive soil disturbance, and physical movement of plants not only burying seeds but also spreading them beyond the original infestation.\n\nFire: Fire effectively kills plants and can help to break seed dormancy. Experience using fire to control other species of broom indicates that it kills a large proportion of seeds but lightly scorched plants may re-sprout.  Follow-up chemical treatment after fire will probably be needed for many years until the seed-bank is depleted. Usually though, fire is not recommended to control broom in Australia due to the risk of out-of-control fires and because it leaves the land initially unusable, with many burnt stems remaining in the ground (CRC 2003).",
    "origin": "White Weeping Broom (Retama raetam) is native to northern Africa and western Sahara, Sicily and the Middle East. In its native range, White Weeping Broom grows in grasslands in the Mediterranean region and is a common feature of deserts and grasslands in the Sahara (CRC 2003).",

    "impact": "Rampion Mignonette has characteristics common to many opportunist weeds of cultivation, a short life cycle, ability to flower at almost any season, and high seed production, some of which germinate immediately while the others remain dormant, and these traits enable it to occupy soil that has been kept bare by cultivation.\n\nAgriculture: In the countries where it is a native, Rampion Mignonette is regarded as a minor weed of cleared ground, having a poor ability to compete with crops (Cooke undated). It does not establish under growing winter annuals and so therefore is unlikely to have potential to become a major weed of broad-acre crops and pastures in the South Australian Dryland Farming System (St John-Sweeting et al. 1998). In 1990s it was estimated that Rampion Mignonette had invaded 38 hectares of vineyards in the Clare area of South Australia.

Following assessment of the nominated weeds, Wild Mignonette was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, given that it was nominated for assessment, Wild Mignonette has the potential to be of national concern. While moderately common in areas, Wild Mignonette is not regarded as having high impact in agriculture or as an environmental weed, being generally confined to scattered plants and small patches (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). A weed of crops, cereals, lucerne, potatoes, pastures, fire breaks, roadsides, river banks and disturbed land.\n\nAgriculture: Plants growing in crops will compete for light and nutrients and presumably lower the productivity to some extent. It is reported as a serious weed in Spain, Morocco and the British Isles (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). There is some evidence that it is toxic to stock and is considered to be of little forage value in Australia, however it is regarded as reasonable sheep fodder in parts of New Zealand (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems: As an environmental weed, it favours riparian sites or margins of swamps and areas prone to inundation, but is most successful where the vegetation is naturally sparse and is rarely reported in high numbers (National Herbarium of Victoria 2007).",

Grazing of young plants by sheep affords some control, but the possibility of poisoning should be considered (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nChemical control: Rosette-stage plants are susceptible to herbicides including 2,4-D and MCPA, but mature plants are to some degree resistant to these chemicals (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nBiological control: Wild Mignonette has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process.

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Cut-leaf Mignonette is a weed of agricultural areas in crops, degraded pastures, also on roadsides and disturbed and degraded areas especially in sandy poor soil, found in fire breaks, fallows, roadsides, riverbanks and disturbed land. They may compete strongly in poorly managed areas, however they are rarely significant weeds of well-managed gardens, crops or pastures.\n\nAgriculture: Cut-leaf Mignonette contaminates produce (both foliage and seed crops) and competes with field crops for light and nutrients.  A weed of cereals, vegetables, seedling lucerne, potatoes, sugar beet, carrots, pastures, fire breaks, fallows, roadsides, riverbanks and disturbed land. It also has the potential to cause major losses in vegetable crops (particularly beet, potato and carrots in Europe) as well as hosting vegetable pests and diseases such as Cucumber Mosaic Virus and Cabbage Root Fly (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Animal and Plant Control Commission of SA 2002). In Australia its greatest potential impact appears to be in cereal crops (Walsh 2007, pers. comm.). Cut-leaf Mignonette is an effective competitor in cereal crops, and can severely reduce yields and the cost of control is expensive. A heavy infestation in a cereal crop can reduce yield by up to 60%. It has been estimated that the cost to the South Australian grains industry due to Cut-leaf Mignonette infestations is approximately $2.2 million per annum. The seed is an unwanted contaminant of broad acre crops and hard to clean from harvested grain. Crops contaminated with Cut-leaf Mignonette can be downgraded in quality resulting in economic losses. Cut-leaf Mignonette is of some use as fodder on land that is too poor for sown pastures to be economically viable. However, it is unpalatable and is only grazed when no other feed is available Government of South Australia (2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Can invade sandy coastal vegetation and roadside reserves.",

Hormone herbicides are effective on young plants ( Slashing and mowing are not very effective because the plant re-shoots from the base (Herbiguide 2021).\n\nNon-chemical control: Small infestations of Cut-leaf Mignonette may be hand-pulled, but larger infestations may be controlled by cultivation at the rosette stage, with follow-up treatments as new seedlings establish so that the soil seed-bank is exhausted (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Grazing and mowing are not successful in controlling this weed because it can regrow from the deep root system (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nChemical control: Rosette-stage plants are susceptible some herbicides but mature plants can show resistance. Older plants can be sprayed with selected herbicides in non-crop areas (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Some chemical control methods are available for cereal crops and pastures. Shoots of cut-leaf Mignonette are easily killed, but translocation of herbicides through the root system is limited and regrowth from the roots occurs. In heavily infested paddocks, the best available herbicide treatments only suppress the weed and yield reduction occurs until the infestation is controlled by repeated spraying (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nBiological control: Cut-leaf Mignonette has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process.

Wild radish is also an alternative host or reservoir for a number of pathogen and insect pests of grain crops (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nNative ecosystems:  While this species is mostly a weed of agricultural areas and habitation, wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) is also troublesome in natural vegetation in some areas, open grassland and open woodland vegetation, and especially in vegetation subject to disturbance, and on the margins in roadsides.\n\nUrban areas: Also a weed of roadsides, parks and gardens  waste, abandoned and little used areas, especially where disturbance occurs.",
    "controlMethods": "As Wild Radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) reproduces by seed, control methods should be targeted at preventing seeding events and destroying existing seed banks (Cheam & Code 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control:  Many different herbicides are available to control Wild Radish in cereals, oilseed crops, vegetables, pastures and orchards. Usually a combination of chemical and non-chemical control methods is most successful in managing Wild Radish, especially in the long term (Cheam & Code 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Hashem 2006). Please see: CABI 2021; DPI NSW (2019); Herbiguide (2021); and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  Hand remove isolated plants several times throughout the year (Western Australian Herbarium (1998–), and methods such as mulching, hand pulling, hoeing and burning can also be used (Cheam & Code 1998).\n\nMechanical control: Repeated cultivation is useful but can destroy soil structure and increase the likelihood of soil erosion. However, in crop situations, cultivation alone will not provide effective control, as seeds of Wild Radish emerge throughout the life of the crop (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Cultivation can be used to speed up depletion of the seed bank. Shallow burial promotes germination and loss of seed viability, while deep burial allows seed to remain viable for longer but reduces the germination rate.\nCompetition and management: Good farm hygiene, incorporating the cleaning of cultivation and harvesting equipment, sowing of clean crop seeds and quarantining stock that may have eaten fruiting material is critical in reducing the spread of Wild Radish into uninfested areas.",
    "origin": "Wild Radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) originates from the Mediterranean region. It has been introduced to most of the temperate world where it occurs as a common weed of cultivation in Europe, South Africa, parts of the United States of America, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand and Australia (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Wild Radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) may be mistaken for several other yellow-flowered brassica-like species, including Brassica, Diplotaxis, Rapistrum and Sinapis. As the fruits of Wild Radish mature, obvious constrictions occur between each of the seeds along the length of the fruits. When ripe, the fruits break at these constrictions to form hard, ribbed, 1-seeded units. This character should serve to differentiate it from other similar species. A weed guide should be consulted for further information on differentiating between these species (e.g. Auld & Medd 1996; Navie 2004; Hussey et al. 2007; Richardson et al. 2006).",

      "Celery Buttercup (Ranunculus sceleratus) is an annual weed, mainly confined to permanently or seasonally wet areas.",
      "It is toxic to stock and humans, and can cause death if consumed in quantity.",
      "Although widespread, it is rarely noted as being particularly abundant or troublesome (other than the potential of its danger to stock).",
      "It produces many (hundreds) of seeds per flower so, if left uncontrolled, has the potential to dominate suitable sites.",

    "habitat": "Celery Buttercup grows in permanently wet sites such as lakes, swamps, stream-margins and drains, as well as sites where water pools for shorter periods during the growing season (winter to spring) such as paddocks and ditches. It occurs mainly in cooler climates and to at least 700m altitude. Plants have been recorded as growing in water at depths of 15 cm, usually in mud, clay, or occasionally gravel. Water may be fresh or polluted, like that of sewerage treatment pondages (Eichler & Walsh 2007; National Herbarium of Victoria 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: While some occurrences of Celery Buttercup may be of large populations, most populations are of relatively few plants (National Herbarium of Victoria 2007), however sometimes it 'grows thickly enough to impede water flow in shallow channels and drains' (Sainty & Jacobs 1994). It is known to be a serious weed of watercourses and marshy fields in North America (Whittemore 1997). Celery-leaved buttercup generally grows in moist or muddy sites (e.g. along drainage lines, on riverbanks, in swamps and marshes, in moist low-lying areas and in poorly drained pastures) and can displace native species from such areas (Weeds of Australia 2016).\n\nAgriculture: The greater cause for concern is its reportedly high toxicity to stock and humans if ingested in the fresh state. Cows have been known to die from eating considerable quantities of the plant (Everist 1974) and cattle deaths in Casino, New South Wales, were attributed to this plant (McBarron 1983). It is regarded as the most toxic species of Ranunculus, the active component being Protoanemonin which causes blistering of the skin (Everist 1974).",
    "controlMethods": "There appears to be no published information on control of Celery Buttercup in Australia.\n\nNon-chemical control: As Ranunculus species generally have only short-term seed viability, removal or mowing of plants prior to seeding should effectively eliminate the plant within about 3 years (assuming there is no reintroduction of seed during this period).\n\nChemical control: Chemical control should be effective, but additional caution should be applied when plants occur in or near water (Trounce 2004).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "similarSpecies": "Although there are numerous native buttercup (Ranunculus) species, none are likely to be confused with Celery Buttercup. The combination of fleshy, hollow stems, small flowers, and more particularly, the somewhat elongated fruiting heads with 100 or more tiny seeds should serve to distinguish this species from any other buttercups. All other native and introduced buttercups on Australia have rounded fruiting structures and larger flowers (>10 mm in diameter) with the exception of Small-flowered Buttercup (Ranunculus sessiliflorus) which has smaller flowers (< 3 mm across) (Navie 2004).",

    "similarSpecies": "Broad-leaf Firethorn is similar to two common weedy Pyracantha species found in Australia. It can be distinguished from Orange Firethorn (P. angustifolia) by its serrated leaf margins, and from Scarlet Firethorn (P. coccinea) by its obtuse to slightly emarginate leaf tips (Navie 2004).\n\nBroad-leaf firethorn (Pyracantha fortuneana) has relatively broad leaves (10–20 mm wide) with almost entire or slightly toothed (i.e. crenulate) margins. These leaves have rounded tips and undersides that are hairless (i.e. glabrous). Its mature fruit are bright red in colour and are usually hairless (i.e. glabrous).\n\nBroad-leaf Firethorn can also be distinguished by the following differences:\n\nOrange firethorn (Pyracantha angustifolia) has relatively narrow leaves (5–13 mm wide) with entire margins. These leaves have rounded tips and undersides that are densely covered with white hairs (i.e. tomentose). Its mature fruit are yellow to deep orange in colour and are usually covered in white hairs (i.e. pubescent).\n\nScarlet firethorn (Pyracantha coccinea) has relatively broad leaves (10–20 mm wide) with finely toothed (i.e. crenulate) margins. These leaves have pointed tips and undersides that are hairless (i.e. glabrous) or slightly hairy (i.e. puberulent). Its mature fruit are bright red or scarlet in colour and are usually hairless (i.e. glabrous).\n\nNepalese firethorn (Pyracantha crenulata) has relatively narrow leaves (6–10 mm wide) with sharply toothed (i.e. serrate) margins. These leaves have pointed tips and undersides that are hairless (i.e. glabrous). Its fruit are bright red or dark red in colour and are usually hairless (i.e. glabrous).\n\nRoger's firethorn (Pyracantha rogersiana) has relatively narrow leaves (5–10 mm wide) with bluntly toothed (i.e. crenate) margins. These leaves have rounded tips and undersides that are hairless (i.e. glabrous). Its fruit are yellow to reddish-orange in colour and are usually hairless (i.e. glabrous).\n\nFirethorns (Pyracantha species) can also be confused with the Cotoneasters (Cotoneaster species) and Hawthorns (Crataegus species). Cotoneasters can be distinguished from Firethorns by the lack of spines on their stems, and Hawthorns can be distinguished by their deeply lobed leaves (Navie 2004).",

    "origin": "Orange Firethorn is native to south-western China (Guizhou, Hubei, Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan, Zhejiang provinces), where it grows in thickets on slopes and roadsides (Gu & Spongberg 2003).",
    "growthForm": "Shrub",
    "similarSpecies": "Orange Firethorn can be distinguished from other closely related weedy Pyracantha species (P. coccinea, P. crenatoserrata [as P. fortuneana], P. rogersiana, and P. crenulata) by its densely hairy or woolly leaf stalks and lower leaf surfaces. The lower leaf surfaces of other Pyracantha species occurring in Australia are generally hairless or sparsely hairy (Blood 2001). Orange firethorn (Pyracantha angustifolia) can also be distinguished by the following differences:\n\nOrange Firethorn (Pyracantha angustifolia) has relatively narrow leaves (5–13 mm wide) with entire margins. These leaves have rounded tips and undersides that are densely covered with white hairs (i.e. tomentose). Its mature fruit are yellow to deep orange in colour and are usually covered in white hairs (i.e. pubescent).\n\nScarlet Firethorn (Pyracantha coccinea) has relatively broad leaves (10–20 mm wide) with finely toothed (i.e. crenulate) margins. These leaves have pointed tips and undersides that are hairless (i.e. glabrous) or slightly hairy (i.e. puberulent). Its mature fruit are bright red or scarlet in colour and are usually hairless (i.e. glabrous).\n\nBroad-leaf Firethorn (Pyracantha crenatoserrata) has relatively broad leaves (10–20 mm wide) with almost entire or slightly toothed (i.e. crenulate) margins. These leaves have rounded tips and undersides that are hairless (i.e. glabrous). Its mature fruit are bright red in colour and are usually hairless (i.e. glabrous).\n\nNepalese Firethorn (Pyracantha crenulata) has relatively narrow leaves (6–10 mm wide) with sharply toothed (i.e. serrate) margins. These leaves have pointed tips and undersides that are hairless (i.e. glabrous). Its fruit are bright red or dark red in colour and are usually hairless (i.e. glabrous).\n\nRoger's Firethorn (Pyracantha rogersiana) has relatively narrow leaves (5–10 mm wide) with bluntly toothed (i.e. crenate) margins. These leaves have rounded tips and undersides that are hairless (i.e. glabrous). Its fruit are yellow to reddish-orange in colour and are usually hairless (i.e. glabrous).\n\nFirethorns (Pyracantha species) can also be confused with the Cotoneasters (Cotoneaster species) and Hawthorns (Crataegus species). Cotoneasters can be distinguished from Firethorns by the lack of spines on their stems, and Hawthorns can be distinguished by their deeply lobed leaves (Navie 2004).",

    "habitat": "In Asia and the United States Kudzu is reported to grow in a wide range of soils. Current infestations in Australia are largely in riparian zones originally supporting subtropical and dry rainforests. As well as along watercourses, Kudzu also occurs on roadsides, in waste areas and disturbed sites, and in moist forests. It grows vigorously in a range of environments and soil types. However, it especially favours deep, loamy soils (North Coast Weeds Advisory Committee 2004; Turnbull & Storrie 2004; The Weed Society of Queensland 2006).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Kudzu is a very aggressive, exceptionally vigorous, environmental and economic weed that spreads rapidly, forming extensive monocultures. This invasive species is of serious concern because of its history as a weed in other parts of the world, particularly in the southern parts of the United States, which has a similar climate to that of the coastal regions of Australia. In southern parts of the United States, Kudzu has infested about 3 million hectares and causes US $500 million damage per annum in lost productivity and control costs (North Coast Weeds Advisory Committee 2004; The Weed Society of Queensland 2006). Kudzu has been included in the list of 100 of the \"World's Worst\" invaders (Miller 2005).\n\nNative ecosystems: It has the ability to out compete and eliminate native plant species and destroy the diversity of native plant and animal communities. Its extremely rapid growth rate and habit of growing over objects threatens natural areas by smothering native vegetation. The rampant growth of Kudzu severely threatens biodiversity through restricting germination of plant seedlings, reducing the amount and diversity of food resources for native fauna and impacting on other habitat values.\n\nHuman: It restricts human movement, smothers fences, power lines, rail lines and other infrastructure and reduces scenic values (Miller 2003; North Coast Weeds Advisory Committee 2004; Turnbull & Storrie 2004; EPPO 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Once Kudzu is introduced into an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate (Stajsic 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nChemical control: Herbicide control can be achieved using cut stump or basal bark techniques or foliar application. The larger tubers will require repeated applications over at least two years. The method of control used will depend on the site situation e.g. open area or amongst other desired vegetation, tuber size, and access. Great care is required in controlling infestations in riparian zones, wetlands and other significant environments in order to minimise any adverse environmental impacts such as off-target damage from herbicides to native plants and aquatic fauna species such as frogs (North Coast Weeds Advisory Committee 2004; Turnbull & Storrie 2004; Miller 2005).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual removal of isolated small plants of Kudzu can be attempted by hand pulling or digging the tubers. This method is practical for a small number of plants. Pigs have also been used as an effective tool for controlling Kudzu as they actively dig out and eat the long tubers. Continual grazing with cattle may weaken the plants enough to kill them. This method should be combined with other control techniques, such as repeated herbicide treatment.\n\nNo biological control agents or pathogens are currently available for the control of Kudzu in Australia. Due to the restricted current distribution of the plant it is more economical to eradicate the plants using a range of other methods rather than biocontrol (North Coast Weeds Advisory Committee 2004).",
    "origin": "Kudzu is a native to many parts of eastern and south-eastern Asia. It has a wide natural distribution which encompasses both temperate and tropical Asia, as well as the south-western Pacific. Nowadays it is found in the far eastern part of the Russian Federation, China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and extends to Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines. In the Pacific region it occurs in Fiji, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu (van der Maesen 1985; The Weed Society of Queensland 2006; GRIN 2007).",

They can tolerate droughts and waterlogging, low nutrient soil and highly saline or alkaline soil. In northern Australia, Mesquite prefers semi-arid to arid rangelands that are prone to flooding and soils that have good moisture retention (CRC 2003; DAFWA).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Mesquite is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. Environmental impacts include land erosion resulting from the loss of grassland habitat that supports native plants and animals; and the provision of safe refuges for feral animals such as pigs and cats (CRC 2003). Mesquite can also increase land degradation and loss of soil moisture due to its extensive and deep root system (Osmond 2003).\n\nAgricultural: Mesquite’s economic impacts stem from its habit of forming dense, impenetrable thickets which, combined with its large thorns, prevent stock accessing watering holes and make mustering difficult. Mesquite also reduces the productivity of pastoral country by taking over grasslands and using valuable water resources. The sharp thorns damage animal hooves, puncture vehicle tyres, and inflict injury to people (Osmond 2003). Livestock which consume excessive amounts of seed pods can be poisoned (CRC 2003).\n\nEnvironment: Mesquite can cause increased land degradation and loss of soil moisture. It reduces biodiversity by outcompeting native plants. It also acts as a refuge for feral animals (Osmond 2003).\n\nHuman: In 2003 it was estimated that $20000 per year was spent on the medical treatment for injuries caused by the the thorns of Mesquite (E Miller pers. comm. in Osmond 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Control is possible using chemical, mechanical and biological methods, and a combination (integrated management). Current research is investigating integration of traditional management practices (chemical and mechanical control) with fire, grazing management and biological control, which are more time- and cost-effective mechanisms. An integrated management strategy for Mesquite will vary with the infestation’s characteristics, including its size, age, density and habitat. In general, multi-stemmed mesquites are harder to control than single-stemmed trees (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: The basal bark and cut-stump techniques are effective on mature trees. Seedlings can be controlled by spraying foliar herbicide over the entire plant. This is particularly effective for dealing with actively growing, dense stands of Mesquite up to 1.5 m tall (CRC 2003). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical control techniques range from blade ploughing to grubbing and chaining. Mechanical control has varying levels of effectiveness depending on the size and species of the plant, but will kill Mesquite if the roots can be removed to a depth of 300 mm.\n\nFire can give good control of Mesquite, particularly Prosopis pallida. If necessary, mechanical control such as chaining can be used before burning to provide enough fuel to generate the heat required to kill Mesquite. Fire is relatively inexpensive and, even when it does not kill the entire plant, can reduce seed production by removing vegetation and killing seed lying on the ground surface. However, most of the other species of Mesquite are more resistant to fire, and resprout from the rootstock if the crown is removed by fire (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Mesquite has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.\n\nResearch for the biocontrol of mesquite (also called algaroba) (Prosopis L. spp. (Fabaceae)) in Australia commenced in early 1990s beginning with testing of two seed-feeding bruchids, from a biocontrol program initiated in South Africa (Harvey et al 2023).  Since this time, four species of insects have been released in Australia and include: the two seed-feeding bruchids (Algarobius bottimeri Kingsolver, Algarobius prosopis (Le Conte)) from North America, and a leaf-feeding psyllid (Prosopidopsylla flava Burckhardt) and leaf-tying moth (Evippe sp.) from Argentina (Harvey et al 2023).  Of these, only the seed feeding bruchid (A. prosopis) and the leaf-tying moth have established.  The leaf-tying moth is highly effective in suppressing the seed production and growth rate of mesquite, particularly in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.  Its presence in NSW however is rare and its impact is somewhat limiting in the Northern Territory and Queensland (Harvey et al 2023).  The seed feeding bruchid (A. prosopis) while widely established, exerts only limited population level regulation (van Klinken 2012; Winston et al. 2022).\n\nFor further information see the Mesquite Best Practice Manual (Osmond 2003) (available at https://www.weeds.org.au/WoNS/Mesquite/).",

    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Purpleflower Devil's Claw is not known to have any major impact on native flora and fauna as it occurs singly or in small patches, rarely forming large colonies, and most often only occurs on disturbed land. It is only documented as occurring in semi arid to arid natural ecosystems. However, as it is a low growing herb, it may have potential to displace other herbs, forbs or grasses (Agriculture Victoria 2021).\n\nAgriculture: A weed of pastures in drier areas. While stock do not graze this plant due to the sticky discharge, serious injury can occur to animals if the hard, clawed (horned) fruit are caught in the mouth or nose. The fruit can also cause damage when the claws work into the animal's body or feet (Robbins et al. 1970; Parson 1973; Lamp & Collet 1976; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001), or lodge around the animals mouth preventing feeding and animals can stave to death. However its preferred habitat it river flats and horticultural crops. This species can compete strongly with summer and horticultural crops such as cotton, and it is particularly drought tolerant due to its extensive root system (Agriculture Victoria 2021; Parsons 1973), with the woody fruits interfering with harvesting causing damage to machinery. Purpleflower Devil's Claw is also grown for its fruit, which are collected when young, and then pickled (Robbins et al. 1970; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

This species is only known to reproduce by seeds and will not resprout from the roots.

It is particularly suited to disturbed areas such as roadsides, railway lines and fencelines, and rapidly colonises bare earth following fire. Able to survive on a range of soil types, it invades crops, grasslands and, particularly, over-grazed pastures. It can become the dominant herbaceous plant in open eucalypt woodlands, and grows vigorously along riverbanks. It tolerates partial shade to full sun but does not cope well under heavy shade. Praxelis is well established in areas that have more than 900 mm annual rainfall and is expected to survive in areas with annual rainfall in the range 500–700 mm. In these drier areas Praxelis behaves more like an annual, setting seed and dying off until the next rainy season, when germination takes place. It will probably only exist in cultivated areas or along waterways in areas where annual rainfall is less than 500 mm (CRC 2003).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Praxelis is on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 non-native plants that threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage.\n\nAgriculture: Praxelis could threaten, and significantly increase the costs of managing, such crops as bananas, other fruits and sugar cane.\n\nNative ecosystems: An invader of both disturbed and relatively undisturbed areas, Praxelis has the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems. It could infest pastoral grasslands and conservation areas, particularly open eucalypt woodlands. There is some evidence that it may be poisonous to stock and humans if ingested (CRC 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Early detection and eradication are important to prevent infestations of Praxelis. Small infestations can be easily eradicated if they are detected early but an ongoing commitment is needed to ensure new infestations do not establish. Do not try to control Praxelis without expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: There are no herbicide products specifically registered for the control of Praxelis in Queensland. However, a permit held by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries allows people generally to use some herbicide products to control Praxelis as an environmental weed in various situations (Qld DAF 2020)\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand pulling of small areas of Praxelis is not recommended.

    "similarSpecies": "Praxelis is very similar to two related weed species, Ageratum conyzoides and Ageratum houstonianum, which are also found in northern Australia. These species are commonly known as 'Blue Top' and 'Billy Goat Weed', and are often mistaken for each other. Both are found as environmental weeds, especially on roadsides and disturbed areas.\n\nThe differences between Praxelis and A. conyzoides are subtle, even to the trained eye. Both have blue flowers, although those on A. conyzoides are often less intense blue and may also be white or pale lilac. Both are covered with hairs, although the hairs on Praxelis are longer and more conspicuous. The main difference is that Praxelis has a conical receptacle for its 'florets', the dense cluster of small flowers that make up the flower head, whereas A. conyzoides has a flat or slightly dome-shaped receptacle. Also, the ring of 'bracts', modified leaves that surround and support the flower head, is deciduous and drops off Praxelis flowers, whereas in A. conyzoides the bracts are persistent. The leaves of Praxelis have a more pungent odour when crushed, and are more triangular and more sharply toothed than those of A. conyzoides, which are more rounded near the tip and have smooth teeth along the edges. Finally, the 'pappus' on Praxelis seeds consists of many more bristles (15-40) than A. conyzoides, which has only about 5 bristles. The flower colour and size of A. houstonianum is usually much closer to that of Praxelis than A. conyzoides, especially in those parts of northern Queensland where the three species occur together (e.g. Atherton Tablelands) (CRC 2003).",

The suckers from the roots form dense stands to crowd out other vegetation\n\nAgriculture: Not generally a weed of agriculture. However, Lombardy Poplar when planted on the boundaries of paddocks can sucker, with suckering plants invading the margins of pastures. It is commonly observed along watercourses through agricultural areas and such trees may be either naturalised or deliberately planted.\n\nNative ecosystems: Lombardy Poplar is a weed in South Africa and has formed dense suckering stands in wetlands near Perth. It is one of 49 non-native naturalised species in the Australian flora having a direct impact on rare and threatened species (Groves et al. 2005). Dense thickets shade out native vegetation and prevent a healthy understorey, thereby decreasing habitat for reliant native animal species. Although they have been used for bank stabilisation, they can result in erosion via the redirection of water and can trap sediment and block flow in rivers.\n\nHuman impacts: The cottony white seeds, resembling white 'fluff' that appear after flowering in around October are reported as causing respiratory irritation to some people (Thorp & Wilson 1998 -; Groves et al. 2005). Strong root systems can disrupt water pipes and crack walls if planted too close to homes can prevent access to rivers.",

Where cutting of the stem occurs and suckers are produced, grazing usually provides some control.\n\nChemical control: Chemical treatment has also been successful on seedlings. Larger trees can be manually removed and treated with herbicide, although follow-up treatment may be necessary (Remaley & Swearingen 2006). Cut the main trunk of large trees and all the suckers and immediately apply neat herbicide (glyphosate is effective) to the cut surface. Foliage of regrowth and new suckers should be sprayed with herbicide and a penetrant every time they appear (Herbguide 2021).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

The suckers from the roots form dense stands to crowd out other vegetation\n\nAgriculture: Not generally a weed of agriculture. However, White Poplar when planted on the boundaries of paddocks can sucker, with suckering plants invading the margins of pastures.\n\nNative ecosystems: White Poplar spreads by suckers and can form dense thickets. Dense thickets shade out native vegetation and prevent a healthy understorey, thereby decreasing habitat for reliant native animal species. Although they have been used for bank stabilisation, they can result in erosion via the redirection of water and can trap sediment and block flow in rivers.  In Western Australia it has formed dense stands in disturbed wetlands from Perth to Albany. It is considered a threat to riparian vegetation in Victoria. It has spread along the Murrumbidgee River and in wet areas in rural parts of the Australian Capital Territory (Groves et al. 2005). In the United States White Poplar out-competes native species in a variety of soil types in sunny conditions (Remaley & Swearingen 2006).\n\nHuman impacts: The cottony white seeds, resembling white 'fluff' that appear after flowering in around October are reported as causing respiratory irritation to some people (Thorp & Wilson 1998 -; Groves et al. 2005). The roots invade and block sewerage and drainage systems (Herbiguide 2021). Strong root systems can disrupt water pipes and crack walls if planted too close to homes can prevent access to rivers.",
    "controlMethods": "There is limited information available on the control of White Poplar in Australia. However, continual cutting of the main tree, regrowth and suckers will eventually control the tree but this usually takes many years.\n\nNon-chemical control: In the United States hand removal of seedlings and small trees has proven successful provided the majority of the root system is also removed to prevent suckering. Where cutting of the stem occurs and suckers are produced, grazing usually provides some control.\n\nChemical control: Chemical treatment has also been successful on seedlings. Larger trees can be manually removed and treated with herbicide, although follow-up treatment may be necessary (Remaley & Swearingen 2006). Cut the main trunk of large trees and all the suckers and immediately apply neat herbicide (glyphosate is effective) to the cut surface. Foliage of regrowth and new suckers should be sprayed with herbicide and a penetrant every time they appear (Herbguide 2021).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Following an assessment process, Myrtle-leaf Milkwort was not included as a WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture:  Myrtle-leaf Milkwort is not a known weed of agriculture or other primary production activities.\n\nNative ecosystems: Myrtle-leaf Milkwort commonly forms very dense shrub-lands and reduces botanical diversity through shading in areas of heavy infestation in open and sandy areas. It can form dense monocultures (stand of only one plant in this case, Myrtle-leaf Milkwort)  eventually becoming the dominate shrub layer that excludes the ability of other desirable plants to establish and survive. Seedlings grow preferably on disturbed, somewhat exposed sites, but can also grow in the low light conditions under established shrub-lands. Mass germination commonly occurs following fire or mechanical removal of vegetation (Muyt 2001; Walsh 2007, pers.comm.).\n\nUrban areas: Myrtle-leaf Milkwort is (or has) been used as a cultivated garden plant, and if not managed, it can self seed. It can often escape the garden and spread beyond property boundaries.",

The cut and swab method (where herbicide is applied to the stump of a felled plant) is also effective if not labour intensive (.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Young plants of Myrtle-leaf Milkwort may be removed by pulling or shallow digging, but this is unlikely to be practicable in heavy infestations where burning or chemical control is preferable as initial control . Follow up removal of seedlings will be required (again, either by hand-pulling, chemical control or through the use of fire for at least 3 years as seeds remain viable in the soil for 2 to 3 years with other reports indicating seed viability to 10 or more years. Myrtle-leaf Milkwort germinate on-mass with 100s of plant a square metre. Its advisable plants to leave small seedlings  as competition between plants reduce plant numbers leaving fewer but larger seedlings or small plants to remove. Plant to 50cm can be reasonably easily hand pulled from sandy soils.\n\nFire: If fire is used as a control measure, some or most plants in a population will need to be killed sometime before the fire as green plants do not burn well (Muyt 2001).\n\nBiological control: No biological control agent is available in Australia.",

The former differs in having larger (1.5–2 cm long) rich purple flowers, while the hybrid has at least some leaves opposite (Walsh 1999).\n\nThere are few native shrubs that are likely to be confused with Myrtle-leaf Milkwort when in flower, but it is vegetatively similar to some native peas (e.g. Templetonia, Podolobium, Pultenaea, Mirbelia etc.). Austral Indigo (Indigofera australis) has flowers of similar colour and shape, but the leaves are composed of several leaflets attached to a central stalk, immediately distinguishing it from the simple-leaved milkworts (Walsh 2007, pers. comm.).",

    "fruit": "",
    "reproduction": "",
    "habitat": "Water Lettuce grows best in still and slow-flowing water, in freshwater lakes, ponds, streams, wetlands, farm dams and reservoirs. In northern Australia, Water Lettuce is naturally found on wetter back-water swamps and associated billabongs, often in shallow water or on mud (Cowie et al. 2000). It has become a weed mostly in eastern Australia where it has invaded and caused problems in irrigation canals, constructed water-storage dams and natural water-bodies. Water Lettuce can survive long periods on wet muddy banks of water-bodies or in damp locations such as roadside culverts (Osmond & Johnson 2006).\n\nUnder tropical conditions in nutrient-rich water, Water Lettuce will produce luxuriant growth and expand rapidly to form obstructive mats (Sainty & Associates 2003). It tolerates temperatures between 15 °C and 35 °C, but optimum temperatures for growth are 22–30 °C. Water Lettuce is susceptible to frost, which limits its distribution in temperate areas (Osmond & Johnson 2006).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Although considered native to northern Australia, Water Lettuce is regarded as a weed in many parts of Australia where it can have impacts on the environment, agriculture, recreation and water supplies.\n\nWater Lettuce is regarded as one of the world's worst weeds (Holm et al. 1977). In Australia it is potentially a serious weed of warm-watered, still to slow-flowing waterbodies. Once established, it spreads quickly over the entire surface of freshwater lakes, ponds, sluggish streams and rivers, canals and other bodies of water (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nProblems occur when the stolon-connected rosettes form extensive dense mats, which obstruct waterways and dams, impeding water traffic, hydroelectric systems and irrigation, and interfering with recreational activities such as boating, swimming and fishing. They hinder flood control efforts by blocking and disrupting water flow in drainage channels. Children and livestock may drown if they become entangled in the roots of a heavy infestation (Land Protection 2006).\n\nAgriculture: There can be an increased water loss in summer in reservoirs by transpiration. Infestation by Water Lettuce can also pollute water with rotting plant material, affecting people, fish, livestock and wildlife (Land Protection 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: Invasion of habitats by Water Lettuce disrupts habitats and ecosystems. The dense plant mass reduces light penetration, oxygen concentrations and pH levels in the water, thus destroying the habitat of fish and waterfowl and can lead to a loss of biodiversity as it out-competes and displaces native water plants. It can also be a serious competitor in rice paddies, taking root in the soil and competing for nutrients and spaces (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nWater Lettuce may form a shelter for, and a breeding site of, disease-carrying mosquitoes, especially a hazard where mosquitoes carry parasites responsible for malaria, Ross River Fever and other diseases (Sainty & Jacobs 1981; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Land Protection 2006).\n\nWithin its natural range on the coastal floodplains of the Northern Territory, Water Lettuce plays an ecological role in initiating the formation of floating grass mats important for wildlife habitats; including nesting places for the saltwater crocodile (Gillett et al. 1989; Hills 1998). In the Northern Territory it is kept in check partly by the moth Nymphula tenebralis which lays its eggs on the leaves and the larvae then feed on the plant (Gillett et al. 1989; Hills 1998). Water Lettuce should only be treated as a noxious weed in made-made water storages in the Northern Territory (Gillet et al. 1989).",
    "controlMethods": "Water Lettuce should not be spread to uninfested waterways and water storages bodies. Plants should not be sold from nurseries or garden centres (banned in most states and territories), or exchanged between aquarium owners.\n\nChemical control: is usually less expensive and more practical than physical removal. Herbicides used to control Water Lettuce that are appropriate for aquatic environments are described by the Department of Agriculture and Food, Government of Western Australia (no date), Rivers III (undated) and Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001).\n\nSee the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical removal is effective, but only practical for small infestations, emphasising the advantage of early detection for controlling Water Lettuce (see Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Rivers 2002; ISSG 2005; Osmond & Johnson 2006).\n\nBiocontrol: Water Lettuce has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control through insects (including weevils and nocturnal moths) and fungal pathogens has been effective. Neohydronomus affinis (sometimes reported as another species N. pulchellus) is a leaf weevil from South America imported into Australia as a potential biological control agent and released into the field in 1982. It controls Water Lettuce effectively in tropical regions (to latitude 22° S), but in cooler regions its effectiveness fluctuates with seasonal conditions. (Harley et al. 1990; Rivers III 2002). In the Northern Territory it is kept in check partly by the moth Nymphula tenebralis which lays its eggs on the leaves and the larvae then feed on the plant (Gillett et al. 1989; Hills 1998). For further details on biological control see DeLoach (1976), Harley et al. (1984, 1990), Gillett et al. (1989), Thompson & Habeck (1989), Waterhouse (1994), Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001) and Dray & Center (2002).\n\nFor further information on general management and control strategies of Water Lettuce see Gillett et al. (1989), Land Protection (2006) and Osmond & Johnson (2006).",
    "origin": "Water Lettuce is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world, including northern Australia. Its origin is not clear, but Water Lettuce is now widely distributed, occurring in Asia, Africa, America, the Caribbean, the Netherlands, several Indian Ocean and Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Weber 2003).

    "habitat": "Radiata Pine can grow in a wide variety of environments including exposed, infertile rocky terrain and can tolerate salt spray, drought and frost when established. It can grow up to 1.5 meters per growing season in good conditions. In Australia it invades native forest, heathland, heathy woodland, lowland grassland, grassy woodland, coastal dunes, riparian vegetation as well as damp and dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands (Blood 2001; Farjon 2005).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Radiata Pine has mostly invaded native vegetation, roadsides and waste ground and spread to these areas from large Radiata Pine plantations.\n\nAgriculture/forestry: Giant pine scale (GPS) is a scale insect that sucks the sap of pine trees. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region, specifically Greece and Turkey. It is now present in Australia originally found in 2014 in suburbs east of Melbourne and in Adelaide. Radiata Pine could be adversely affected by GPS if infested with GPS, with GPS also threatening other commercial soft wood plantations, affecting some or all species of Abies (fir trees), Picea (spruce tree) and Pinus (pine trees). Reports from Europe indicate that large populations of giant pine scale can cause severe dehydration and dieback of branches. In some cases, this is followed by tree death. The pest has also caused defoliation of pines in parts of Italy and Turkey, with a significant impact in urban and forest environments (Government of South Australia undated).\n\nNative ecosystems: Radiata Pine can have a dramatic effect on the environment. The thick pine leaf litter can reduce the fertility and change nutrient cycling in soils as well as changing the water cycle. This leaf litter will also create a thick layer that prevent seedling establishment especially of native species reducing plant biodiversity in the area. Radiata Pine is considered a threat to Mediterranean ecosystems worldwide. In Australia they are known to invade into open dry environments both in native remnant vegetation and forests (Blood 2001; Lindenmayer & McCarthy 2001; Muyt 2001; Baker et al. 2007; Williams & Wardle 2007), in open eucalypt forests with a consequent reduction in species diversity. Radiata Pine invades heathland and heathy woodland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, damp sclerophyll forest, and riparian vegetation (Carr et al 1992) both in coastal and in land environments especially in sandy soils.\n\nHuman impact: Pine species also impact on human health. Physical contact with pine trees, pine pollen or pine dust can cause dermatitis and allergy responses in sensitive people (Rademaker 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Radiata Pine control methods are similar to other pine species and woody weeds. Control work should be planned to minimise disturbance to existing native vegetation. Controlled sites need to be monitored and follow-up treatment applied to re-sprouting stumps and seedlings.  Follow-up is essential as Aleppo pines have a high germination rate and seedlings can appear soon after adult trees are removed. The follow-up work should be undertaken before the seedlings reach sexual maturity at four years of age.\n\nNon-chemical control: Seedlings can be hand pulled or dug out as long as the main root is removed. Younger infestations may be treated by cutting with a brush-cutter (Government of South Australia 2021). Trees can be cut down or ringbarked without the need for herbicide use. Mechanical control of large trees appears to be an effective method of removal, with felled trees often pushed into large piles for burning.\n\nFire: For large scale removal fire may be an appropriate tool however temperate is important as is follow up to prevent post fire regeneration (Muyt 2001).  Infrequent fires can allow Pine seedlings to reach maturity and produce seeds creating a seed dispersal event rather than acting as a control method (Muyt 2001; Williams & Wardle 2007).\n\nChemical control: Large standing trees may be stem-injected with herbicide. Younger infestations may be treated with herbicides, (Government of South Australia 2021). Younger Radiata Pine infestations may be treated with foliar herbicide or by cutting with a brush-cutter or saw and applying herbicide. Radiata Pines must be cut as close to the ground as possible, all green needles need to be removed to ensure the stumps do not re-sprout. Swabbing the stump with herbicide immediately after cutting can increases the kill rate.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Although only in the early stages of establishment, these weeds have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystem.\n\nNative ecosystems: Loss of botanical biodiversity is perhaps the greatest potential impact of Orange Hawkweed. Its ability to quickly establish and spread is evident from the relatively few known outbreaks to date, attributes that are typical of other species of the genus which have become very serious environmental weeds in other countries. In New Zealand, Hieracium pilosella and H. lepidulum have been reported to displace inter-tussock vegetation in Festuca-dominated montane and subalpine moorlands (Rose et al. 1995).\n\nIt is conceivable that it would successfully compete with native herbs that occupy inter-tussock spaces in alpine and subalpine grasslands and woodlands, several of which are regarded as rare and/or threatened in Australia (e.g. some Euphrasia species, Euchiton species, Pelargonium helmsii etc.). Outside of natural areas, the species is capable of being a significant weed in lawns, gardens etc (Morgan 2000; Walsh 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nAgriculture: It is likely to impact indirectly on livestock by displacing potentially more nutritious pasture species.",

Small plants may be dug out, but the risk of fragmenting the parent plant and either inadvertently spreading it to new sites, or leaving segments of roots in the soil that may then resprout requires that a careful assessment of the infestation is made before control is attempted (Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, British Columbia, undated; CRC 2003).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",

    "impact": "Soldier Thistle (Picnomon acarna) is mostly a weed of agriculture, but also invades roadsides, channel banks and other disturbed areas. The sharp spines can injure animals and people.\n\nAgriculture: Invades both cropping and pastures. In pastures sheep and cattle avoid grazing it because it is so spiny, and the available infested areas are reduced, while Soldier Thistle spreads further. When well established, Soldier Thistle competes with cereal crops and interferes with harvesting by clogging machinery. Its sharp spines can injure sheep, dogs and humans and decrease grazing areas by excluding stock ( Agriculture Victoria 2021; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: May invade degraded and disturbed areas, especially on the edges of native vegetation.\n\nUrban areas: Can invade roadsides and abandoned and disturbed sites. Its sharp spines can injure dogs and humans.",
    "controlMethods": "Soldier Thistle (Picnomon acarna) can be controlled by herbicides, and non-mechanical means like physical, and mechanical methods. The method used depends on the age of plants, size of the infestation, and where they are growing.\n\nChemical control: Herbicide is effective at the rosette stage, but the plant becomes harder to kill as it gets older. Spraying of older plants should be discouraged as it is not entirely effective and promotes resistance to some herbicides (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  For sparse populations, the most effective means of control is hand grubbing.\n\nMechanical control: Larger infestations of mature plants can be controlled by cultivating, mowing or slashing before flowering.\nCompetition and management: Increased fertility of soil excludes the weed because other species are more competitive in more fertile soils. As with other weedy thistles, maintaining healthy dense pastures helps exclude Soldier Thistle, while cultivation and herbicide application in cropping will help mange the weed.",

But Golden Bamboo differs from other species of Phyllostachys, including those with brighter yellow culms, in having a raised collar below the nodes and extremely shortened and asymmetrically swollen basal internodes, forming a zigzag pattern (Stapleton & Barkworth 2007). Mature culms of Black Bamboo are shiny black, immature ones green (Romanowski 1993; Sydney Weeds Committees 2008). Japanese Timber Bamboo can grow to 20 m tall and 15 cm diameter, the culms usually green, although there are 2 cultivars grown in Australia, \"Castilloni\" with golden culms striped with green, growing to 10 m, and \"Holochrysa\" with bright-gold culms (Romanowski 1993).\n\nThere is a tropical equivalent of Black Bamboo from the genus Gigantochloa. These species and cultivars have culms ageing to deep brown or black, often with fine coloured stripes, and large ornamental leaves. Gigantochloa is a genus of clumping bamboos with a different rhizome system to Phyllostachys and so doesn't become weedy (Romanowski 1993). Japanese Timber Bamboo, one of the largest of the Phyllostachys species, looks very similar to some of the very large tropical Bambusa species. Bambusa are clumping rather than running bamboos, three of which are native to Australia and many others are cultivated (Jacobs & Hastings 1993; Romanowski 1993).",

Lippia is well adapted to the floodplain environments of river systems in temperate to subtropical areas. The plant tolerates frost and drought and established plants can survive inundation by floodwater for at least three months. Lippia will grow in heavy clay soils, as well as lighter clays and sandy soils (DPI NSW, 2019). Lippia can tolerate drought and frost, and can survive long periods of inundation. It readily establishes on bare ground and has the ability to take over large areas of land along waterways and adjacent higher ground (DAF, Queensland Government 2020).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Lippia was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WoNS). Following an assessment process, Lippia was not included as one of the 20 WoNS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. It is a serious environmental and pastoral weed in the Murray-Darling river system in Queensland and New South Wales. Lippia is well adapted to floodplains and adjacent areas, and is extremely difficult to control. In Queensland the area covered by Lippia was recorded as 1 million hectares from a total catchment of 2.5 million in the Condamine catchment, and 1.16 million hectares of the Border Rivers catchment (both New South Wales and Queensland) (Earl 2003). It has little to no grazing value and causes major environmental impacts in terms of increasing soil erosion and decreasing stream bank stability due to loss of perennial grasses and the reduction of plant diversity (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nAgriculture: Lippia probably imposes its most long-reaching impact on primary production in grazing country. It appears to be either unpalatable to stock and/or too short to be easily consumed. Infestations can dominate pastures and lead to reduced stocking rates or productivity of grazing lands. Sheep grazing on Lippia can develop copper deficiency which is detrimental to the quality of their wool. (Leigh & Walton 2004). An aggressive weed that out-competes pasture species, reducing stocking rates by up to 90% (DAF, Queensland Government 2020).\n\nIt is also thought that Lippia can reduce seed set in commercial crops as bees prefer Lippia to Lucerne flowers. As a result, pollination of the commercial crop is reduced. It may reduce water availability to crops and inhibit the germination and growth of other plant species, for example, lettuce crops. However, this inhibitory affect may be due to the dense mass of roots left by a Lippia infestation physically preventing other plants establishing rather than an allopathic affect (inhibition of establishment and growth of other individual plants or species by releasing chemical compounds into the environment) (Leigh & Walton 2004).\n\nNative ecosystems:  Lippia is an environmental and economic weed in some parts of Queensland and is already a significant problem in New South Wales (Leigh & Walton 2004). Serious environmental and pastoral weed in Murray-Darling river system. Poses a serious threat to protected wetland areas forming dense carpet-like spread prevents growth of other riparian vegetation. The spreading nature and deep rooting system of Lippia are some of the main concerns with this plant. Both characteristics are associated with stream bank and soil erosion, structural damage to roads, and high control costs (Leigh & Walton 2004). The plant has a taproot up to 2 metres deep and in river or creek bank situations these large taproots act like wedges and will actually cause large sections of the bank to break away and fall into the waterway (NWWCC 2002), resulting soil erosion, decreasing bank stability and degrading waterway health and quality.\n\nUrban areas: In urban areas it can invade lawns and take over especially in lawns prone to flooding.",
    "controlMethods": "Long-term control of Lippia is best achieved through an integrated approach involving use of herbicides, mechanical control, pasture improvement and grazing management (Motley et al. 2001). However, it may be difficult to implement control strategies in some cases, as there are many situations where conventional control methods are either uneconomic or impractical (Lucy et al. 1995). Although the species has been subject to years of trials by landholders and researchers, a comprehensive manual of treatment methods for all situations has not been developed. For further information about control methods for Lippia see; DPI NSW (2019); Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Queensland Government, (2020).\n\nChemical control: A broad-leaved weed that occurs in pasture situations, some herbicides can be used to reduce Lippia infestations without harming competitive grasses. No herbicide will effectively suppress growth in the long term. Due to Lippia's ability to rapidly recover and spread. Multiple herbicide applications within a season have been shown to give better suppression than single applications. However, herbicide control can become costly in areas with large infestations. Herbicide control is not suitable in riparian areas due to risk of polluting waterways. Also, herbicides should not be applied immediately after rain or if heavy rain is forecast. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control, in paddocks short-term control can be achieved where infestations can be ploughed or harrowed. This method is not practical if Lippia is growing in riparian zones (such as creekbanks) due to high risk of erosion and soil loss. Not usually a problem in cropping areas as can be readily ploughed into soil. However, machinery easily spreads Lippia, so machinery working in infested areas should be washed down before leaving area. When Lippia is actively growing and soil moisture levels are good, herbicide can be used in conjunction with mechanical control to give better results.\n\nGrazing management, DPI NSW (2019) state as a general rule, do not graze new pasture grasses until they have become well established and are producing tillers. Sensible grazing in the establishment year can promote tillering and increased seed production.\n\nBiological control: There are no biological control agents currently available for Lippia, and to date it has not been targeted for research. (Leigh & Walton 2004)",
    "origin": "According to most literature, Lippia is native to the South American (Richardson 1994; USDA 2003), and naturalised elsewhere. However, as a widely cultivated species, the origins of this species are not clear. For example, Lippia has recently been recorded as having only a tropical to subtropical world distribution (Dellow et al. 2001) but this is not confirmed by its current distribution across a large range of climatic types (Leigh & Walton 2004).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Lippia is closely related to the species in the genera Lippia and Lantana. Most Lippia and Lantana are either shrubs or sub-shrubs, in contrast to the trailing prostrate form of Phyla (Munir 1993).\n\nIn Australia Lippia (Phyla canescens) will be confused with Phyla nodiflora. The leaves of P. canescens are covered with fine greyish hairs and have blunt short teeth on the margins, while those of P. nodilfora lack the grey hairs and have sharp more pronounced teeth on the margins (Munir 1993). The major occurrences of P. nodiflora are in the higher rainfall, more humid coastal regions, and the species appears to be adapted to lighter, sandy soils whereas Lippia is found in the lower, more temperate regions of Australia and appears well adapted to heavier clay soils, particularly in floodplain environments (Lucy et al. 1995).",

It could affect biomass by clambering over vegetation and destroying it. It forms large impenetrable thickets and the large spiny stems and branches make control of large infestations very difficult. It has the ability to regrow from stumps and herbicidal control may not be completely effective unless carried out correctly. The succulent fruits are attractive to birds as a food source and are readily dispersed enabling new populations to establish and if unchecked may result in rapid spread. It could seriously injure people and restrict access to riverbanks and have a major impact on recreation and tourism (CRC 2003; Victorian Resources Online 2007).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "African Rue is a drought resistant shrub that competes with native shrubs and grasses for moisture and nutrients affecting pasture production in the Rangelands grazing areas. It has a competitive advantage over native plants as it germinates earlier in the spring. This weed is difficult to control once established (DPIRD WA 2021). They also have an allelopathic effect, inhibiting both germination and growth of some plants (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nAgriculture: African Rue can be toxic due to the presence of several alkaloids occurring in all parts of the plant. However, the plant appears to be highly unpalatable to stock due to its bitter taste, and there are few actual reports of poisonings (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). If consumed by stock, it can cause livestock poisonings, especially during drought. Consumption by animals causes reduced fertility and abortions. It is also a known agricultural seed contaminant (DPIRD WA 2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Although it is a vigorously growing plant, it only occurs sporadically in small patches throughout parts of South Australia, and only occasionally in New South Wales and Victoria. Its effect on native plant communities is unknown, but it is somewhat drought and salt tolerant, and could cause considerable problems in semi-arid and arid regions (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "A difficult to control plant once established, African Rue can be control be physical removal and herbicides, with repeated herbicide application proving most successful.\n\nNon-chemical control: Individual plants of African Rue can be dug out and burned relatively easily, however, as regrowth can occur from any root fragments left in the soil. The roots are extensive in established plants with the root system  spreading both down and out, and can respond to light rains and deeply penetrating soil moisture with the taproot recorded to reach down 2.5 m and lateral roots to more than three metres (Government of South Australia 2021). Due to the extensive root system that regrows if left in the soil chemical control is considered to be more efficient (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can be applied to the leaves prior to flowering, with repeated spraying as required until the plants are killed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; DPIRD WA 2021) due to the plant's ability to regenerate from deep in the soil profile (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nGovernment of South Australia (2021) state, that a knock-down herbicide, applied during early flowering, will control most growth above ground. If applied earlier than flowering, plants may be too small to absorb enough herbicide to kill the entire root system and many plants may still be emerging from winter senescence. If applied late in the flowering period there may not be sufficient translocation to kill the entire root system. As the herbicide has no residual properties, seedlings and roots that survived the treatment are subsequently able to emerge. Spot spraying with non-selective soil-active herbicides provides useful control of African Rue on roadsides, but damage to desirable plants will occur. Established plants that have the surface 25 mm of soil removed by road works will re-establish from their subterranean stems. In farming areas with close crop-pasture rotations weed control during cropping years is likely to limit African Rue.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "habitat": "Parthenium Weed (Parthenium hysterophorus) can be prolific in disturbed situations, both natural and unnatural, and has a marked preference for highly fertile, black, alkaline, cracking clay soils but does grow on other soils, albeit not usually as vigorously. Climatically Parthenium Weed (Parthenium hysterophorus) is best suited to areas with an annual summer rainfall greater than 500 mm. Flooded country is also very prone to Parthenium Weed infestations (CRC 2003).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Parthenium Weed (Parthenium hysterophorus) is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, economic, environmental and health impacts. All parts of the Parthenium plant at any stage of growth are toxic to humans and animals.\n\nAgriculture: Parthenium Weed is a major problem in range-lands and summer-cropping areas (especially in Queensland), costing farmers and graziers over $22 million a year in reduced production and increased management costs. It has a serious impacts on the pastoral industry and readily colonises disturbed and heavily stocked areas, reduces both pasture establishment and potential, and is a host for crop viruses. It is somewhat toxic to livestock and taints meat and milk. Kaur (2014) reported that Parthenium Weed is toxic to animals causing dermatitis with pronounced skin lesions and is responsible for mouth-ulcers with excessive salivation on various animals including horses and cattle. Livestock do not usually eat Parthenium Weed but if no other feed is available, they may eat large amounts and this can cause kidney damage in ruminants (cattle, sheep and goats) (DPI NSW 2019). Kaur (2014) states that consumption is significant amounts of Parthenium Weed in cattle (10–50%) can kill. Young cattle are most susceptible to dying from parthenium poisoning (DPI NSW 2019). Parthenium Weed also contains chemicals and exerts strong allelopathic effects on different crops (prohibits the germination and growth of seeds), also affecting nodulation (production of nitrogen fixing bacteria) in legumes due to inhibition of activity of nitrogen fixing and nitrifying bacteria (Kaur 2014).\n\nNative ecosystems:  Parthenium Weed can invade native vegetation. In Queensland it threatens biodiversity in the Einasleigh Uplands bio-region and native grassland in the central highlands. Parthenium Weed has been reported to to causing a total habitat change in native Australian grasslands, open woodlands, river banks, and flood plains (Kaur 2014).\n\nUrban areas: Can invade urban areas and gardens further impacting people.\n\nPeople: Negatively impacts humans with the pollen grains and airborne dried plant parts, causing severe allergic dermatitis in some, while in others the pollen may cause hay fever, asthma (CRC 2003). The best way to prevent an allergic reaction to Parthenium Weed is to avoid contact with it, especially breathing pollen from flowering plants (CRC 2003). Physical contact can cause great discomfort (Kaur 2014).",
    "controlMethods": "Parthenium Weed (Parthenium hysterophorus) can be controlled by chemical and physical methods, and management and cultivation. Quarantine methods, i.e. ensuring that farm machinery and other vehicles, grain and livestock that are moved between properties or imported are clean of Parthenium Weed seed, are important in preventing spread of seed.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can be used to successfully kill plants. Spot and boom spraying are used to control the weed.  Herbicides, including rates of application, used for the control of Parthenium Weed are listed in web-based information sheets produced by the DPI NSW (2019); Queensland Government, Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (2020); and in Navie et al. (1998). For general information of the use of chemicals please visit the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority at http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control is possible for small and limited plants in the rosette (juvenile) stage or before flowering and seed setting.  Don’t pull up mature plants by hand if they have already set seed as there is a danger that mature seeds will drop off the plant and increase the area of infestation. Warning: Hand-pulling of plants without using gloves and facial mask may result in allergic reactions.\n\nCompetition and management:  Pasture management the planting of vigorous pastures or crops provides competition to Parthenium Weed. The light grazing of pastures helps prevent invasion or re-establishment of Parthenium Weed. However, caution is advised as Kaur (2014) reported if Parthenium Weed eaten by animals is potentially toxic and can have negative impacts causing dermatitis with pronounced skin lesions.\n\nCultivation: It can also be controlled by cultivating before sowing and by subsequent use of herbicides.\n\nBiological control: Parthenium Weed has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control is one tool that forms part of an integrated management program for large-scale scattered and dense infestations. However, biological control on its own will not eradicate Parthenium Weed infestations. The leaf beetle Zygogramma bicolorata; and the stem moth Epiblema strenuana, cause the most damage.\n\nOther biological control agents include: a stem boring weevil from Argentina, Listronotus setosipennis; a seed-feeding weevil, Smicronyx lutulentus, which lays eggs in the flower buds, leaving the newly hatched grubs to feed on the seed heads; a leaf mining moth, Bucculatrix parthenica, from Mexico, whose grubs feed on the leaves of Parthenium Weed; a stem-galling weevil, Conotrachelus albocinereus, from Argentina; and Carmentia ithacae, a stem boring moth from Mexico (CRC 2003).\n\nParsons & Cuthbertson (2001) give a general overview of control methods, and other overviews can be accessed in CRC (2003), Chamberlain & Gittens (2003), Agfacts (2004) and Natural Resources & Water (2006).",
    "origin": "Parthenium Weed (Parthenium hysterophorus) was originally described and formally named from material gathered in Jamaica. The species is native to the Caribbean region (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001), and according to some reports also other regions of central America, Mexico and parts of South America (e.g. CRC 2003; Navie et al. 1998).\n\nIt is considered to be an introduction to the United States (USDA undated) and introduced to many other regions, including Israel, Kenya, South Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, the Seychelles, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, parts of China, Vietnam, Taiwan, many Pacific island (including Hawaii, New Caledonia, New Guinea & Tahiti) and Australia.",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Parkinsonia is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. Parkinsonia has the potential to invade more than three quarters of mainland Australia.\n\nAgriculture: Plants can form dense impenetrable thickets on rangelands and wetlands, making areas of land inaccessible for people and animals. Thickets can be up to several kilometres across. Cattle are difficult to muster in paddocks where Parkinsonia infestations are thick. Access to watering points is impaired by the thickets which also shade out valuable pastures and displaces native vegetation when left untreated. Parkinsonia can dam watercourses, cause erosion, and lower water tables. A very hardy plant that can withstand long dry spells. Seeds remain viable for many years (Smith 2002). Parkinsonia infestations provide refuges for feral animals especially pigs (CRC 2003; Deveze 2004).",
    "controlMethods": "The economic costs of control are high once Parkinsonia becomes established. The prevention of spread within and between catchments, early detection and control of small manageable outbreaks are thus high priorities when considering management strategies (CRC 2003).\n\nSoil or sand which could contain Parkinsonia seeds should not be removed from infested areas. Any transport or machinery used in infested areas should be thoroughly cleaned before moving to other areas. Because water is responsible for much of the spread of Parkinsonia, outbreaks on watercourses, particularly in upper catchments, are a priority for control (CRC 2003).\n\nResearch into Parkinsonia control commenced in the 1950s and has been ongoing. The results from this research have shown that seedlings are particularly susceptible to different forms of control, especially fire, drought or inundation, soon after germination. An integrated approach using several weed management techniques (e.g. mechanical and chemical control, fire) is the most effective way to deal with dense infestations of Parkinsonia. However, the characteristics of the infestation (e.g. size, density, location, position within the catchment) and the availability of resources will determine the exact course that control should take.\n\nChemical control: There is a wide range of herbicides registered for Parkinsonia control, with several different application methods. Herbicides are useful for controlling dense high priority infestations but otherwise may be too expensive for widespread use. Particular care with herbicides should be taken near waterways (CRC 2003). Herbicides can be applied in a number of ways including aerial spraying and manual foliar application. Basal bark spraying and cut stump application can also be effective. For general information of the use of chemicals please visit the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority at http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical removal, such as hand pulling for small plants and bulldozing or chain pulling for larger plants, can be effective as long as roots are removed to a depth of 200 mm to prevent regrowth. Mechanical removal is more cost-effective that chemical control over large areas. However, it is not advised for river banks due to the potential for erosion and damage to non-target species. Follow-up is essential to treat seedlings (which can germinate prolifically in the disturbed ground) and any remaining adult plants (CRC 2003).\n\nFire kills seedlings and seeds on the surface and is an excellent form of follow-up control after mechanical or chemical control. With mature plants, however, the results are mixed. The Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines is currently researching which fire regimes give maximum kill rates of mature Parkinsonia in central Queensland (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Parkinsonia has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control has yet to show any major successes but research is continuing (CRC 2003).\n\nFor more detailed information on control strategies see Deveze (2004).\n\nFor further information see the Parkinsonia Best Practice Manual (available at https://www.weeds.org.au/WoNS/Parkinsonia)",
    "origin": "Parkinsonia is native to tropical regions of the Americas, from the southern regions of the United States to northern South America (e.g. Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama and Peru).\n\nIt has been introduced to some South American countries (including mainland Ecuador and El Salvador) and many other regions, including tropical Africa, the Middle East, Italy, Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, many Pacific islands (e.g. Hawaii, Tahiti) and Australia.",

It is recommended that long clothing, a dust mask or half face respirator, eye protection and protective gloves be worn when handling this weed (Sydney Weeds Committees undated A).\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Control involves hand-pulling plants, taking care to remove the entire root system to prevent reshooting. Plants should be placed in a plastic bag and put in the garbage. Clothing, tools and gloves should be checked for pieces of the plant, to prevent further spread. Bare soils should be mulched to reduce regrowth. Repeated follow up treatment is needed to eradicate this weed. If roots are firmly caught in cracks in stone walls or concrete, herbicide may be required.\n\nChemical control: Herbicide should be applied to the plants while actively growing, and prior to flowering if possible (Sydney Weeds Committees undated A). Before commencing any chemical control program, contact your local council's weeds officer or see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

      "In Australia, it is only known from Christmas Island, where it is considered an aggressive weed.",
      "It is widespread in tropical and temperate areas of Asia and North and South America, owing to its tolerance of a wide range of soil and climatic conditions.",
      "It grows aggressively and can smother under-story, mid-story and over-storey vegetation, displacing native understorey species, and actively damaging overstorey trees."

    "reproduction": "",
    "habitat": "In its native range, Skunk Vine occurs on grassy hillsides, forests, open forests, river banks, waste areas, tickets, roadsides and urban areas. Its wide natural distribution and the diversity of zones in which it inhabits suggest that Skunk Vine is tolerant of a wide variety of soil, climatic and hydrological conditions (Pemberton & Pratt 2002).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Skunk Vine invades a variety of habitats and grows quickly and aggressively (Starr et al. 2003). It invades numerous plant communities and can create dense canopies leading to the death or damage of native vegetation. It can also form dense mats in the understorey and can smother and displace native species and alter community structure (Pemberton & Pratt 2002; Weber 2003). Skunk Vine can climb and smother mid-story and over-storey trees, resulting in the collapse of the tree or branches (Pemberton & Pratt 2002). It quickly colonises tree-fall gaps, preventing forest regeneration (Weber 2003).\n\nUrban environments: Although primarily a weed of natural ecosystems, agricultural and urban environment damage does occur. It is particularly problematic in Hawaii where it invades urban areas and smothers ornamental plants and forms mats over lawns.\n\nAgriculture: It is also a serious weed of nurseries in Hawaii, where it invades field plantations used for propagation (Pemberton & Pratt 2002). Skunk Vine can be a serious weed of young sugar cane (PIER 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: It is possible to control small infestations of Skunk Vine by mechanical removal, although regrowth is likely in dense infestations (Starr et al. 2003). Large-scale hand removal has proven to be ineffective as cut stems die from above, but regrow from the roots. Care must be taken not to dispose of cut plants in areas where seeds can germinate or stem fragments can take root (Langeland et al. 2008).\n\nChemical control: Skunk Vine can be controlled with directed herbicide applications to foliage, being careful to avoid surrounding native vegetation, although some non-target damage is probable. It can be controlled with basal bark applications, taking care to only apply to the vines and not surrounding vegetation (PIER 2007).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "Skunk Vine is native to tropical and temperate eastern and southern Asia. At its northern limits in Japan, temperatures can reach as low as -20°C, thus it is able to tolerate temperate conditions (Starr et al. 2003). Its southern limits are Christmas Island and Timor (Pemberton & Pratt 2002). It is widely cultivated and/or naturalised in, for example, the south-eastern United States of America and Hawaii, tropical South America, Mauritius, Reunion, Sri Lanka and New Guinea (Pemberton & Pratt 2002; GRIN 2008). It is considered to be an aggressive weed on Christmas Island and Mauritius (Starr et al. 2003).",

    "habitat": "Soursob prefers heavier, fertile, well drained soils (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) with autumn, winter and spring rains. In Australia, it invades coastal heath vegetation, grassland, woodland and dry forest. It also occurs along roadsides, in gardens, orchards, crops and pastures (Thorp & Wilson 1998 – ). It tolerates temperatures down to -5oC, sun and shade and prefers annual rainfall of over 330 mm (Blood 2001). It rarely invades undisturbed plant communities (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Soursob (Oxalis pes-caprae) is primarily a weed rapidly establishing and affecting cool to warm temperate, to semi arid, and sub-tropical cultivated or disturbed areas. It is not uncommon for infestations to have up to 3000 plants per square metre.\n\nAgriculture: At large densities, Soursob is strongly competitive with cereal crops and has been measured in Western Australia to reduce the yield of wheat by 75% and oats by 87% (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Yield losses in wheat of up to 50% have been recorded in South Australia. However, Soursob is no longer a major competitor with cereals and other broadacre crops, where it is readily controlled by herbicides and most landholders see the value of keeping properties free of the weed. Soursob is also important in pastures where it may replace almost all desirable plants from the time of the autumn rains to well into the spring potentially seriously reducing in carrying capacity. Although it grows in permanent pastures, it is very slow to spread without soil movement or cultivation.\n\nSoursob is poisonous to stock due to a high concentration of oxalate in all its parts. The oxalate ion precipitates as insoluble calcium oxalate crystals in the brain or kidneys. Sheep are most susceptible at the start of the season when they are not accustomed to the plant. Sheep that have been exposed to Soursob are seldom seriously affected as they build up a bacterial population in the rumen capable of breaking down oxalates (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nSome orchardists and vine growers value Soursob for the ability of its roots and rhizomes in helping break up clay soils, improving aeration and water penetration. It is also thought to be useful in honey production (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: It is also an important weed of bush land, where its low, spreading growth in autumn quickly covers the ground, preventing germination of other seedlings and smothering surrounding plants (Blood 2001). Soursob has a severe impact on indigenous ground-flora with dense infestations eradicating most smaller plants. It occurs in medium to large populations in a number of different vegetative communities including; dry coastal vegetation and some dunes, heathland & woody heathland, lowland grassland & grassy woodland; dry sclerophyll forest & woodland, riparian vegetation, and rock outcrop vegetation, no doubt also impacting on the habitat of native fauna.\n\nUrban areas: A common and persistent weed in gardens, lawns, on roads sides, and in amenity plantings, and neglected and abandoned areas. Known to be mildly toxic to humans, especially when consumed in larger quantities.",
    "controlMethods": "Soursob (Oxalis pes-caprae) is difficult to eradicate unless control methods are well timed and persistent over several years. The plant must be attacked at a critical stage in its life cycle called the bulb exhaustion stage. This is when the food material of the  bulb is exhausted and any new bulbils are not sufficiently developed to survive. Unfortunately this stage cannot be accurately determined by looking at the aerial growth, only by digging up plants and inspecting the bulbs. The bulb exhaustion stage is just at, or just prior, to flowering. Unfortunately, not all plants in an infestation will be at the same stage at the same time. Any control method, be it cultivation or chemical, should be aimed at this critical stage (Muyt 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nChemical control: Chemical control of Soursob is often the most practical option available for dense infestations in bushland and in cropping areas. It is practical on both a large and small scale, avoids soil disturbance and prevents soil erosion (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nFoliar sprays:  Spot spray is the method of application. Apply at bulb exhaustion stage, generally just on flowering. Read the manufacturers' labels and material safety data sheets before using herbicides.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au . NOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most states and territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Occasional Soursob plants may be carefully dug out, but hand removal after bulbil formation will dislodge bulbils and contribute to their spread (Muyt 2001; Brown & Brooks 2002). Exercise care if manually removing as physical removal can result in further spread of bulbils. Repeated pulling of the tops will deplete the bulb’s carbohydrate reserves, but these efforts take years to be successful.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation can provide control on new infestations. Repeated tillage is required to effectively control the bulbs.\n\nCultural: Grazing is not considered an effective control option. Plants contain variable quantities of soluble oxalates and can be lethally toxic to livestock when ingested in quantity.\n\nFire: Burning is also not considered to be an effective control option.",
    "origin": "Soursob originated in South Africa and, with several other species of Oxalis, was taken to Europe in the 18th century for promotion as an ornamental plant. It soon became established as a weed in southern Europe where it is common in orchards, vineyards and cereal crops, particularly in Italy, Greece, Malta and Portugal. From Europe it has spread all over the world including Australia and it is also a troublesome weed in other including North and South America, New Zealand, Morocco, India, Israel, Lebanon, Tunisia and even in its native South Africa (where it is proclaimed a noxious weed) (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Soursob can be mistaken for clover when not in flower or for other weedy Oxalis species (Blood 2001). Oxalis flava also has yellow flowers but these are solitary and its leaves are fan-like with 4-7 narrow leaflets (Hussey et al. 1997). Oxalis compressa bears clusters of bright yellow flowers on long leafless stalks that are very similar to Soursob but it can be distinguished by its flattened hairy leaf stalk (Hussey et al. 1997).",

Red Rice prefers to grow in full sun and can be found it water up to 4 m deep. It is generally found on clay/loam or black soils and can tolerate acidic soils. In the Cape York area of Far North Queensland Red Rice forms grasslands with Oryza australiensis on the extensive alluvial coastal plains (Neldner et al. 1997; NAPPO 2003; Western Australian Herbarium 1998-; Bao-Rong Lu & Jackson undated).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: Red Rice is considered a weed in commercial rice crops. Red Rice impacts on agriculture by contaminating and reducing the value of commercial harvested rice. While grains of Red Rice in harvested commercial white rice will not affect the taste of the product, in the eyes of the consumer they look like foreign particles and therefore reduce the monetary value of the product (NAPPO 2003; Scher undated).\n\nThe location of much of the Australian Rice Industry is further south than the natural distribution of Red Rice. Red Rice has not become a problematic weed in Australian rice growing areas yet. In northern Australia Red Rice is seen as a beneficial fodder crop and there is some concern in the Cape York region that additional agricultural pressure could have negative affects on Oryza grassland communities (Neldner et al. 1997; Cameron & Lemcke 1999; The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator 2005; AVH 2008).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Manual removal of Red Rice from rice paddies is very hard as it is almost impossible, prior to flowering and seeding, to distinguish Red Rice from the desired commercial rice. One control method is to plant commercial rice in rows and remove all rice seedlings that emerge and are deviating from the row pattern. Red Rice can best be controlled through prevention. This may involve the removal of all rice seedlings from nearby water sources and drainage that flows into the commercial rice bed. This will reduce the potential for Red Rice seeds to be transported by water or soil movement. A program of strategic planning and crop rotation with other grain or legume crops also allow for undesired rice seedlings to germinate in an environment where they can be identified and removed (NAPPO 2003).",
    "origin": "Red Rice is found in Australia, Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam (Neldner et al. 1997; NAPPO 2003; Bao-Rong Lu & Jackson undated).",

This includes commercial rice that has moved out of the cultivation situation and has returned to its red seed (grain) appearance (NAPPO 2003; The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator 2005).\n\nCommercial rice and O. longistaminata are similar, and can be confused, with Red Rice, Red Rice is considered to be one of the parent plants of the rice grown commercial around the world. This close relationship means that Red Rice is hard to distinguish from the desired commercial rice growing in the field. Red Rice can also easily hybridize with commercial rice thus making identification even more problematic. Red Rice is best identified when in flower and producing seed; however, by this time it will have been competing with the desired commercial rice for space and resources for weeks (NAPPO 2003; The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator 2005: Scher undated).\n\nCommercial rice has what are termed persistent flower clusters or spikelets, meaning the seed holding spikelets stay on the plant, whereas Red Rice has deciduous spikelets.

    "habitat": "There does not appear to be any particular preference for habitat for any of the broomrape species. Branched Broomrape occurs in alkaline sandy soils in the Murray mallee region, while common broomrape and the native species are frequently found in sand hills which might suggest that sandy soils are the best for growth of the haustorium which forms the attachment between the broomrape and the host species. However, one specimen of the native broomrape has been recorded from heavy black clay in Victoria (Barker 1999: W.R.Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nDistribution will presumably be governed by the presence of suitable hosts. Since the number of potential host plants for Branched Broomrape is large, it is a threat to any area where such plants occur. Host plants documented elsewhere include Celery, Chickpea, Tomato, Lettuce, Coriander, Onions, Potato, Sunflower, Tobacco, Canola, White Mustard, Cabbage, Vetch, Carrot, Faba Bean, Cannabis and Clover, as well as a number of weeds and even some native daisies (Faithfull & McLaren 2004; Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity Conservation. updated 2007).\n\nCommon Broomrape is a weed of crops and gardens in temperate regions and is occasionally also found in subtropical environments (Navie 2004).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Broomrape was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Broomrape Bush was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national signficance.\n\nAgriculture: Branched Broomrape is such a devastating parasitic weed that it has been known to reduce crop yields by up to 90%. It parasitises a wide range of crops, including vegetables such as Carrots, Tomatoe, Potatoe and beans and also legume crops. A farming area of South Australia has been quarantined for at least 12 years in an attempt to prevent its spread in Australia (cost for one year of quarantine alone is $4.5 million) (Warren 2006). The seed are so microscopic that it is easily spread by a variety of means and also easily contaminates seeds of harvested crops (Holding 2004; W.R.Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nCommon Broomrape is a less aggressive species, which attaches to such plants as Gazania and Clover (W.R..Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "controlMethods": "Broomrapes are species targeted for national eradication under the National Resource Management Ministerial Council's National Cost-Sharing Eradication Programmes. These programmes map and monitor the full distribution of the species, and coordinate or undertake activities to eradicate that species from Australia.\n\nEffective control has meant that there has to be an understanding of the biology of Branched Broomrape. Such a programme has been underway since 2002 (Matthews et al. 2006). There is still some confusion surrounding the name which should be applied to the introduced South Australian material (W.R.Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nNon-chemical control: In order to control the outbreak of Branched Broomrape in South Australia the region affected has been placed under quarantine to prevent spread of the weed outside the infected area by livestock and machinery. Legislation and protocols pertaining to the quarantine area is documented in the Code of the Minister for Environment & Conservation (2003). Grain harvesters and other farm machinery must be decontaminated, crops must be inspected before harvest, and movement of grain, straw and livestock is controlled to try to contain the infestation.\n\nVarious means aimed at reducing the seedbank of Broomrape within the soil have been tested. These have included fumigation with methyl bromide and Basamid and studies of Interceptor, a product derived from Pinus pulp (Williams et al. 2006). The other method being trialled is \"suicide germination\" where Broomrape seeds are stimulated to germinate by artificial means rather than by the presence of a trigger from a host (Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity Conservation SA 2007; Virtue et al. 2006). Other techniques for reducing the soil seedbank such as solarisation, trap crops etc. are documented in Virtue & Jupp (2002).",
    "origin": "Broomrapes are mostly native to Europe and Asia and there are about 140 species worldwide. Some species are more undesirable than others, but Branched Broomrape, Egyptian Broomrape (O. aegyptica), Nodding Broomrape (O. cernua var. cernua), Crenate Broomrape (O. crenata) and Sunflower Broomrape Orobanche cernua var. cumana [as O. cumana] appear to be the worst of them (Faithfull & McLaren 2004). Branched Broomrape is banned in many countries of the world (Scher undated).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Distinguishing between the species of Broomrape in Australia is crucial since one of the species is native and becoming increasingly rare. Since the native species is known only to attach to native plants, particularly native Senecio species, the identity of the host can be a good guide to the species involved (W.R.Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nCommon Broomrape (Orobanche minor) is frequently associated with Gazania species, but is also known to attach to legume species such as clovers (hence one of its common names), to Capeweed, and to nasturtiums and petunias (W.R..Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nBranched Broomrape (Orobanche ramosa) attaches to, or has the ability to attach to, a wide range of plants, including crop plants such as Tomato, Lettuce, Coriander, Canola, White Mustard, Cabbage, Vetch, Carrot, Chick Pea, Faba Bean and Annual White Clover (Department of Water, Land and Biodiversity Conservation updated 2007), to other weeds such as Nightshades (Solanum nigrum spp.), Amaranthus species, Brassica spp. and Daisy species such as capeweed (Arctotheca) and Dandelion (Taraxacum). However Branched Broomrape has also been recorded attaching to some native daisies such as Brachyscome and Senecio and so some further distinguishing characteristics are necessary to separate it from the native Orobanche species (W.R.Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nAs its name implies, Branched Broomrape has branched stems while the other two species are unbranched. Furthermore the calyx in Branched Broomrape is 5-lobed and surrounds the base of the corolla (floral) tube while in the other two species the calyx lobes do not completely surround the corolla tube but leave the upper part of the tube exposed. The corolla tube of the flowers of Branched Broomrape is narrowed within the calyx, opening into a wider throat, whereas the corolla tube in the other two species is broadest at the base and narrowing into the throat. The petals are more noticeable in the Branched Broomrape flowers and pale blue in the introduced populations in South Australia. Common Broomrape also has pale blue or whitish flowers but has darker venation while the native broomrape has dark blue-purple flower lobes. See Faithfull & McLaren (2004).\n\nBroomrape may also be confused with the Potato Orchids (Gastrodia spp.) with their similar brownish colour but the flowers are very different from the blue-purple flowers of Broomrape (R.M.Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: Common Prickly Pear is an aggressive drought tolerant weed that is easily dispersed by fragmentation. Dense infestations can impede movement of stock, lay waste to agricultural and pastoral lands By 1926 half of the area infested with Common Prickly Pear was so densely covered that it could no longer be used for grazing or agriculture (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Chinnock 2007 pers. comm.).\n\nIt can harbour pests such as rabbits. Spines and glochids can cause injury to humans and animals. The fruits are hosts to fruit fly (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Land Protection 2006b).\n\nStock does not usually graze on common Prickly Pear due to the presence of the spines and bristles which can damage their mouths. However, in times of drought plants are eaten which may have contributed to its spread during the drought of 1902 (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Prickly Pears can dominate the vegetation of rocky outcrops displacing natives, some of which may be restricted to such outcrops, and consequently be relatively rare (GISD 2005).",
    "controlMethods": "Early control measures including digging up and burning or crushing using horses and bullocks were of limited use. Early attempts of chemical control found the most effective chemical was arsenic pentoxide but this was extremely toxic to man and animals but it continued to be used up to the early 1920s (Land Protection 2006a).\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical removal and burning can be used to control Common Prickly Pear infestations. All dislodged segments and fruit must be destroyed to prevent reestablishment. As much of the root system as possible should be removed by grubbing or cultivation (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nBiological control: Common Prickly Pear has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control by cactoblastis insect can be used in suitable areas and is very effective for small outbreaks.\n\nCactoblastis control has its limitations due to the insect not thriving in dry conditions or on plants growing on poor soils, and they are not effective against all species of Prickly Pear. Today, Cactoblastis and Cochineal in addition to chemical treatments continue to be used to control outbreaks of Prickly Pear (Land Protection 2006a).\n\nChemical control: A number of herbicides are also effective by spraying or injecting (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Common Prickly Pear flowers tend to be smaller (5–8 cm across) and the purplish-reddish fruit have scattered areoles. Velvet Tree Pear has a fine pubescence on the stem segments and fruits and has orange-red flowers (Navie 2004; Chinnock 2007 pers. comm.).\n\nDrooping Tree Pear (Opuntia monacantha) is also a taller shrub or tree (usually 2–5 m tall) with very flattened and elongated stem segments that are deep green and shiny. Its relatively thin stem segments (usually only 4–6 mm thick) droop towards the ground during fruiting. Its flowers and fruit are similar to those of Common Prickly Pear (Navie 2004; Chinnock 2007, pers. comm.).",

In Australia, a number of species are naturalised in sub-humid, semi-arid and arid areas in sub-tropical, tropical and warm temperate regions (Telford 1984; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) and cool temperate areas. All Opuntia species are drought resistant as their reduced leaves and succulent stems minimise water loss (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Prickly Pears (Opuntia) can form dense patches that are virtually impenetrable to people and most animals and can harbour pest species. Opuntia species can have serious impacts on agriculture, the environment, and aesthetically posing a risk to human and animal welfare and safety (Sheehan & Potter 2017).\n\nAgriculture: Prickly Pears can form dense patches that are virtually impenetrable to stock and other animals, and can harbour pest species such as rabbits. Furthermore, the fruits of some species can harbour fruit fly which can be difficult to eradicate without destroying all the fruits within a population. These species are not readily grazed due to their stout spines, and these can cause injury to animals and humans as they readily pierce the skin, cause irritation, and glochids can be difficult to remove. Where they occur in dense patches on cultivated land they can significantly reduce land productivity (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems:  Although scattered plants have little effect on native ecosystems, dense infestations can affect biodiversity by hindering the growth and regeneration of native plants, particularly small shrubs and ground-flora (Muyt 2001).\n\nUrban areas: Plants can take over in neglected or abandoned areas, and can further spread to similar areas, roads verges and reserves, in towns and cities in arid to temperate areas.\n\nHealth and safety concerns: Plants can cause serious injury to humans and domestic pets. Physical injury associated with Opuntia species is from the spines and glochids. These are borne on the areoles on pads and flowering and fruiting body (Chinnock 2015). The large spines can can inflict considerable injury, penetrating skin requiring careful removal to avoid further damage. Removal of spines can result in bleeding followed by bruising, and in rare cases serious infection, and in extreme cases death can occur (Chinnock 2015). Glochids are small hair-like sharp detachable spines with reverse barbs produced in dense cluster on the areoles. These small glochids penetrate and irritate skin, and are barely visible to impossible to see with out the aid of a hand-lens. These features create difficulties when trying to identify the remove glochids from affected skin. Even glochids detached from plant on equipment, surfaces or clothes can also penetrate skin if brushed past.\n\nFor further information on impacts and safety and wellbeing see, ‘Managing Opuntioid Cacti in Australia; Best practice control manual for Austrocylindropuntia, Cylindropuntia and Opuntia species’ at: https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/sites/gateway/files/Opuntioid%20cacti%20best%20practice%20control%20manual.pdf",
    "controlMethods": "When controlling Opuntia Prickly Pear species, an integrated weed management approach is usually desirable especially for larger infestations.\n\nChemical control: While several herbicides are recommended for managing Prickly Pears, chemical control is not always effective, as many species occur on rocky slopes, and infested areas must be checked and resprayed over several years if necessary (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Methods used are:\n\nFoliar spray covering all pads\nStem injection (includes drill and fill method on every 2-3 pads)\nBasal bark and cut stump (not normally used or considered best practice).\n\nHowever, plants are extremely hardy and follow up and monitoring may be required for 1-2 years to ensure plant do not re-sprout. Registered herbicides,  techniques and on-label instruction should always be followed in your state or territory. A variety of herbicides (chemicals) are know to be effective. Please see Sheehan & Potter (2017) for an overview. Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au. Permits from state or territory Environment Protection Authorities may be required if herbicides are to be sprayed on riverbanks.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical control either by manual (hand) or mechanical (machine) removal can be feasible and cost-effective for all species of Opuntia (Prickly Pears).\n\nManual (hand) removal appears to be one of the most effective control methods for for scattered and small infestations (Sheehan & Potter 2017). However, the spines make manual removal of these species difficult (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Using tools and avoiding spines and glochids is a top health and safety concern when working with Prickly Pears. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) must (should) be worn, and tools used that eliminate or significantly reducing handling of plants with spines and glochids used.\n\nMechanical (machine removal) is useful for large dense impenetrable stands (Sheehan & Potter 2017). This method is useful for removing bio-mass and increases accessibility for other follow-up control methods. Machine removal with front end loaders causes high levels of disturbance and will require planning and long term follow-up using an integrated weed management techniques for cacti and other weeds that could colonise the area. Normally mechanical control should be carried out when conditions are dry to avoid damaging soil reducing soil disturbance, reducing likely spread of plants. However caution should be employed as some species have glochids that are airborne and are more likely to dislodges and injure workers with PPE like masks or respirators worn with eye protection\n\nDisposal: Care must also be taken to remove and properly dispose of plants parts. Pads, flowers, fruits and even small sections of stems if left on the soil surface can produce roots and grow into a new plant. If one larges plant is uprooted, broken up, and left on the soil surface, each pad will take root and form a new plant. Where one plant was present there would now be many plants. The root system must also be dug out to prevent regrowth (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Plant can be buried at a depth of 1 metre on or off site. Burning plants (all vegetative, flowering and fruiting parts) with other dry materials for plants thahave dried out over summer can also be used to kill plants. However, you should consult you local fire service for advice and permissions.\n\nFire: The effect of fire on Prickly Pears are not well understood. For some species it has been shown that fire is not effective in killing all plants and they can recover with great vigour. In addition, fire and strong winds are thought to spread the stem segments of some species aiding spread (Sheehan & Potter 2017).\n\nBiological control: Biological control using Cactoblastis moths or Cochineal insects can be effective on dense populations, and outlying plants can be infected by transferring infected pads to them (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). However, there are a number of species of Cochineal insects that are host specific, and may destroy one species of Opuntia but not others (R. Chinnock, pers. comm.). The effect of these agents appears to be limited in colder climates (Muyt 2001).  Correct identification of Opuntia species is required so the host specific biological control can be used.

The stem segments are smooth, shiny, greater than 10 mm thick, deep green but usually reddish to reddish brown on the margins and around the areoles. Flowers are orange yellow (Navie 2004, Chinnock pers. comm. 2007).\n\nIndian Fig (Opuntia ficus-indica) forms a shrub or small tree 1–5.5 m tall. The stem segments are obovate to broadly obovate and very thick 2–3 cm thick, mid green. The yellow flowers are solitary, 7–10 cm diameter (Navie 2004, Chinnock pers. comm. 2007).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Taurian Thistle (Onopordum tauricum) is one of seventeen sleeper weeds identified by the Bureau of Rural Sciences (following consultation with the Australian Weeds Committee) which could have nationally significant impacts on agriculture if allowed to spread. Could seriously impact agricultural and other disturbed areas including native vegetation and urban areas.\n\nAgriculture: Taurian Thistle has the potential to become a serious agricultural weed, especially in marginal or overgrazed areas or and bare patches and disturbed sites /  It will occupy space in pasture, deterring grazing animals and humans, contaminating fodder, invading grain crops reducing growth, and contaminating marketable grain. Severe infestations can form tall, dense, impenetrable stands which restrict access of large mammals to foraging and watering areas and may harbour pest species. The spiny leaves and stems deter most herbivores except maybe goats (which graze on related spiny thistles like Onopordum illyricum). It may have a major impact on the carrying capacity of infested pasture land by more than 5% (Healy, Enloe & DiTomaso 2005; RBWD 2005; DPI 2007). It is possible that Taurian Thistle could contaminate wool, similarly to the related (Onopordum acanthium & O. illyricum) (DPI 2007)\n\nNative ecosystems: Although thought to be a serious weed of agriculture, Taurian Thistle could also invade open native vegetation and degraded and disturbed vegetation. Taurian Thistle seedlings do not compete well with established perennial grasses. It requires open space to establish and establishes in highly disturbed ecosystems. It is therefore unlikely to have a major impact on intact ecosystems (Healy, Enloe & DiTomaso 2005; DPI 2007). In grasslands and open scrub it can strongly compete with native plants for resources and may have a minor impact on the forb and herb layers, but not on the shrub layer ecosystems (Healy, Enloe & DiTomaso 2005; DPI 2007). In grassland and open scrub, where this plant invades the dried vegetation adds to the fuel load, most likely causing a moderate increase in the intensity of fires (Davis 1975; DPI 2007). Taurian Thistle plant will reduce the amount of native vegetation growing and also its availability as a food source to native animals. Infestations may reduce the number of animals in a local area (DPI 2007).\n\nUrban areas: Could impact roadside and parks and gardens, and abandoned areas around habitations and towns. Large dense infestations can form impenetrable stands which restrict access of people to recreation areas.",
    "controlMethods": "Hand-hoeing and herbicide application have been effective in reducing Taurian Thistle (Onopordum tauricum) infestation from an infestation of 15 ha over an area of 150 ha of pasture in 1984 to about 60 plants in 1999. By 2001 the numbers were even further reduced (Groves et al. 2002). The many control methods for other Onopordum species can be used for Taurian Thistle.\n\nChemical control: Herbicide control of these three Onopordum species can be very effective and is an essential part of the overall management of these thistles and are used on large or dense infestations applying . However, plants can be tricky  to kill  because of the difficulty in wetting the woolly-hairy leaves of the plants. To achieve an effective kill the following should be considered; Timing of application is also important. If a single application of herbicide is undertaken then a springtime application is best (Dellow 1996), as herbicides are most effective on seedlings and young rosettes, Once plants begins stem elongation, herbicides may be less effective; The hairy leaves of the thistles can reduce herbicide effectiveness through reduced absorption. Therefore it is important to follow the herbicide label and use the recommended rate, application volume and adjuvant; Control will be reduced if plants are stressed. When there is a low density of thistles spot spraying  is preferred (DPI NSW 2019). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information available at http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  Because Taurian Thistle requires open space to establish and generally establishes in highly disturbed ecosystems reducing stock levels and allowing perennial grasses to establish is likely to drastically reduce the establishment of weed seedlings (Healy, Enloe & DiTomaso, 2005).  When there is a low density of thistles hand chipping is effective. Remove as much of the taproot as possible so that regrowth does not occur. Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Slashing or mowing is not usually effective as plants develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Plants can be mown or slashed before flowering to prevent seed set but this is temporary as plants will regrow and develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed and spread seed.\n\nCompetition and management: Pasture management is the most important part of any thistle control program is maintaining a dense, vigorous and competitive pasture. A vigorous perennial grass pasture provides competition for germinating thistles, reducing seedling establishment. Gaps in the pasture result in an increase in thistle germination and seedling survival so maintaining excellent ground cover at all times is desirable (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nWhile thistles respond to increases in soil fertility (and in particular nitrogen), management of all pasture types should aim to maintain pastures that have a good balance of perennial grass to legume content. Fertiliser application (as determined by a soil test) will improve the vigour of annual and perennial introduced grasses, increasing ground cover and reducing future thistle establishment.\n\nThistles are generally avoided by stock. However goats eat thistles at both the rosette and flowering stage as well as post-flowering and are known to be effective. This can be a vital step as it reduces seed production and thus limits recruitment of new thistle plants and also reduces the build up of seed in the soil. The soil seedbank is relatively long-lived.\n\nBiological control: Taurian Thistle has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Weevils were introduced to Australia to control this genus in 1992, but it was found that less than 20% of O. tauricum capitula were attacked (Briese, 2000). Taurian thistles are still capable of seed production under most herbivory pressure (Agriculture Victoria 2021).",

    "habitat": "Scotch Thistle and Illyrian Thistle are weeds of pasture, and irrigated and dryland cropping areas in temperate south-eastern Australia with predominantly winter rainfall of about 500 and 900 mm per year. They prefer soils of moderate to high fertility especially with elevated levels of nitrogen. They do not grow well on waterlogged soils but prefer well-drained soils and tolerate stony soils (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Hussey et al. 1997; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).\n\nStemless Thistle is commonly found in dryland and irrigated horticultural areas, and dryland cropping areas, with predominantly winter rainfall up to 450 mm, often on sandy or calcareous soils (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). The occurrence on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales where rainfall is much higher (to 800 mm per year) indicates the potential for the species to spread. The recent new occurrence in Tasmania in an area with about 550 mm rain per year reaffirms this potential. Stemless Thistle is generally found in drier, though still arable areas, than is usual for both Scotch and Illyrian Thistles (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Hussey et al. 1997; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Onopordum spp. were included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Onopordum species were not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, they remains a weed of potential national significance. Once established thistles are difficult and expensive to control. Dense thistle populations can reduce property values.\n\nAgriculture: Onopordum spp. are significant pasture and cropping weeds. All three species of Onopordum have a serious impact on agricultural production by occupying space in pastures and crops thus reducing production.  Large rosettes can prevent the growth of desirable species. Their prickly nature means livestock rarely eat them, or if they do cause injury to stock. They also reducing the value of grain and hay by increasing the likelihood of contamination with seeds of these declared noxious weeds. (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Hussey et al. 1997; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005). Dense stands of mature thistles create barriers that hinder livestock movement. Parts of the plant can break off causing vegetable fault and thus a loss in value for the wool. Thistles can cause injury to livestock and people handling the livestock or fleece. Thistles are prolific seeders and can spread quickly if not controlled (DPI NSW 2008)\n\nNative ecosystems: Although a serious weed of agriculture, also invades open native vegetation and degraded and disturbed vegetation.\n\nUrban areas: Found along roadsides and waste areas, abandoned blocks, and in parks and in gardens.",
    "controlMethods": "Control of Onopordum spp. is difficult and therefore time consuming and expensive. The best defence against invasion of Onopordum spp. on agricultural lands is maintaining healthy perennial pasture with good ground cover at all times to prevent seedling establishment. for dense infestations an integrated management program using of a range of tools such as the maintenance of a strong perennial pasture, strategic herbicide application, chipping by hand and use of biological control agents where appropriate is the best strategy for long term control. The key to managing thistles is reduce or prevent plants setting viable seed, and in doing so the following year’s population will be greatly reduced (DPI NSW 2019)\n\nChemical control: Herbicide control of these three Onopordum species can be very effective and is an essential part of the overall management of these thistles and are used on large or dense infestations applying . However, plants can be tricky  to kill  because of the difficulty in wetting the woolly-hairy leaves of the plants. To achieve an effective kill the following should be considered; Timing of application is also important. If a single application of herbicide is undertaken then a springtime application is best (Dellow 1996), as herbicides are most effective on seedlings and young rosettes, Once plants begins stem elongation, herbicides may be less effective; The hairy leaves of the thistles can reduce herbicide effectiveness through reduced absorption. Therefore it is important to follow the herbicide label and use the recommended rate, application volume and adjuvant; Control will be reduced if plants are stressed. When there is a low density of thistles spot spraying  is preferred (DPI NSW 2019). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information available at http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  When there is a low density of thistles hand chipping is effective. Remove as much of the taproot as possible so that regrowth does not occur. Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Slashing or mowing is not usually effective as plants develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation is effective on seedlings or young rosettes if they are uprooted. Older rosettes are damaged by cultivation but are able to regrow, especially if the soil is moist. Plants can be mown or slashed before flowering to prevent seed set but this is temporary as plants will regrow and develop new growth from the base. Immature seed heads that are cut and left lying on the ground can contain viable seed and spread seed.\n\nCompetition and management: Pasture management is the most important part of any thistle control program and maintaining a dense, vigorous and competitive, and vigorous perennial grass pasture provides competition for germinating thistles, reducing seedling establishment. Gaps in the pasture result in an increase in thistle germination and seedling survival so maintaining excellent ground cover at all times is desirable (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nWhile thistles respond to increases in soil fertility (and in particular nitrogen), management of all pasture types should aim to maintain pastures that have a good balance of perennial grass to legume content. Fertiliser application (as determined by a soil test) will improve the vigour of annual and perennial introduced grasses, increasing ground cover and reducing future thistle establishment.\n\nThistles are generally avoided by stock. However goats eat thistles at both the rosette and flowering stage as well as post-flowering. Horses, and sometimes cattle graze the flower which can reduce the amount of seed. The amount eaten depends on the grazing pressure and the amount of other feed available (DPI NSW 2019).  With existing infestations of Illyrian Thistle goats are known to be effective in grazing the rosettes, and also the flower-heads once the plant has elongated. This can be a vital step as it reduces seed production and thus limits recruitment of new thistle plants and also reduces the build up of seed in the soil. The soil seedbank is relatively long-lived (Holst & Allan 1996).\n\nBiological control: Onopordum spp. has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control of all three Onopordum thistles discussed here is under study with three insects released into infestations – a seed head weevil, a stem boring weevil and a crown moth the larvae of which attacks leafstalks, the crown of the rosette and also the roots (Dellow & Holtkamp 2005). The following summary is taken from DPI NSW (2019)\n\nSeed-head weevil. The seed-head weevil, Larinus latus, was released in spring 1992. A single larva is capable of destroying all the seed in a flower head of 3 cm diameter or less and more than one larva may develop in larger heads. This weevil has only one generation per year so it has taken a number of years for populations to grow large enough to destroy most of the seed in a flower head. This insect has reduced seed production by more than 80 per cent.\n\nStem-boring weevil. The stem-boring weevil, Lixus cardui, was first released in November 1993 and is now widely established. The stem-boring weevil is not capable of killing Onopordum thistles. Its activity weakens the plant, makes it less competitive and reduces seed production. This action allows insects such as the seed head weevil to have a greater impact on the plant.\n\nCrown moth. The crown moth, Eublemma amoena, was first released in 1998. There are three adult generations per year, commencing in spring when adults emerge from pupal cells in thistle rosettes. Females lay eggs on leaves and larvae feed in the leaf petioles, causing leaves to shrivel and die. Larvae can also bore into the crown and root of the plant. This may lead to the death of smaller plants. Larvae of subsequent generations feed in the leaves of stems, causing similar leaf shriveling, reducing plant vigour.\n\nRosette weevil. The rosette weevil, Trichosirocalus briesei, was first released in 1997. It is now established in many areas and is starting to have an impact on thistle populations. Adults are 3–5 mm long and a mottled brown colour. There is one generation per year. Adults emerge from a summer dormancy period following autumn rains and commence feeding on rosette leaves. Females lay eggs near the base of the rosette leaves. After hatching, larvae destroy the growing point of the rosette either killing the plant or severely reducing its vigour.\n\nFor further information on the control of Onopordum spp. see Keith Turnbull Research Institute (1998), DPI NSW (2008); DPI NSW 2019; DPIW (2002), and the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia (undated);",
    "origin": "Scotch Thistle occurs naturally from central, south-eastern and south-western Europe (e.g. Germany, France, Bulgaria, Greece) across into Siberia, the Caucasus (e.g. Armenia and Georgia), western Asia (Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Turkey) and the Indian Subcontinent (Pakistan).\n\nStemless Thistle is native to northern Africa (Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia) and south-western Europe (France and Spain).\n\nIllyrian Thistle is found from south-eastern and south-western Europe (e.g. Albania, Greece, Crete, France, Portugal and Spain) (GRIN 2007).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Scotch Thistle and Illyrian Thistle are difficult to tell apart. The rosette and stem leaves of Illyrian Thistle are more deeply lobed than in Scotch Thistle and the individual purple flowers are longer than 25 mm in Illyrian Thistle, less than 25 mm in Scotch Thistle. Dellow and Holtkamp (2005) provides a useful comparison table.\n\nStemless Thistle generally has broader rosette leaves than the other two species and never develops a long stem. Instead it bears the flowerheads on the middle of the rosette, has white or purple individual flowers in the flowerheads, and has a very long (about 2.5 cm) tuft of bristles (the pappus) on top of each newly formed seed, whereas the other two species have a pappus only about 1 cm long.\n\nThe white woolly to cottony hairs on leaves and stems of these three species of Onopordum thistle distinguish them as a group from all other thistles that have invaded this country. The fourth Onopordum species, Taurian Thistle (Onopordum tauricum) differs from these three species in lacking the white woolly hairs, being generally green-leaved instead with many minute glandular hairs.\n\nAlso see Navie (2004).",

Mechanically control is not normally used as plant regrow with little moisture.\n\nChemical control: The most cost-effective way of removing small or isolated patches of Calomba Daisy is by spot spraying. Larger areas of broadacre infestations can be controlled with  a range of herbicides selected to prevent damage to crops and pasture (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).

Individual trees live for many centuries and retain the ability to regenerate from stumps after felling or burning, as well as forming a large seedbank in the soil.

The pollen a known allergen causing hay fever in susceptible individuals.\n\nAgriculture: In grazing paddocks, the plant may be effectively controlled by stock, as it is quite palatable, but it can become a major weed of parkland where grazing is low or absent.  Olives are highly flammable due to their oil content and therefore increase fire risk compared to grazing or other horticulture Government of South Australia (2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Olives are very adept at invading and establishing in new environments to become the dominant plant species and is able to invade most healthy intact native vegetation, including woodlands, grasslands, and is a major pest plant of grassy woodlands and invade riverine environments (Agriculture Victoria 2021). Olives out compete native vegetation reducing both floral and faunal biodiversity, and contain volatile oils increasing bushfire risk. It can alter the composition of native vegetation by shading and crowding out other species and preventing their regeneration (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Muyt 2001). Olive infestations reduce the abundance and diversity of native plant species, altering the canopy structure of woodlands and preventing native regeneration. Native canopy cover may be reduced by 80% and native species diversity by 50% (Government of South Australia 2021). However, the infestations providing a fruit crop rich in fats can be significant for many small bird and mammal species. Species reported eating the fruit and dispersing the seed include many birds including emu, currawong and silvereye, and other animals like wombats (Agriculture Victoria 2021), with seeds spread by animals particularly birds in to new weed free natural areas and other environments.\n\nUrban areas: A weed of roadsides and waste land, parks and urban plantings, and pockets of remnant and re-vegetated native vegetation.",
    "controlMethods": "European Olives can be controlled by physical means, both with hand tools for smaller plants and mechanically with machinery for larger plants sometimes in conjunction with herbicides as part of integrated controls. In parkland or bushland, control may be achieved by physical, mechanical or chemical means. Effective control requires a long-term plan as trees are hardy, have a vigorous and persistent root systems and a substantial long-lived seed bank, with regrowth and ongoing germination requiring a continued control effort over many years for mature and established populations.\n\nNon-chemical control: European Olive plants are readily controlled on farms by increasing grazing. Smaller seedling to sapling to 30-10 cm tall can be hand pulled when the soil is moist through enabling removal of the large tap root with disturbed soil should be tamped down after removal preventing further germination of olives or other weeds. During drier times or for larger plant to 1.5 metres, may be grubbed out with a mattock or chip-hoe. These and lager trees and established old populations and shrubs can be cut down and treated with chemicals will normally require repeated herbicide treatment to kill the plants.  Drill and fill Holes are drilled 2-3 cm deep, into the lignotuber and trunk, about 40 mm apart and for a minimum of three rows. A registered herbicide is then applied within 20 seconds to the holes.  Frill and fill Grooves are cut with a hatchet or chainsaw around the lignotuber and trunk, 2-3 cm deep, about 40 mm apart (being careful not to ringbark the plant), at a 450 angle and for a minimum of three rows (the more the better). Fill each groove or cut with herbicide within 20 seconds. Suitable for small and mature trees. Can be treated all year, however avoid hot periods when the plant may be stressed. Removing mature trees and populations usually resulting in heavy seedling regeneration so followup work over many years is likely required. Mature trees and their stumps can be bulldozed or mechanically removed, however the potential damage this may cause to soils must be weighed up (Government of South Australia 2016).\n\nChemical control: For smaller plants to 1.5 metres tall spot spraying is effective with a registered herbicide at label rates, and the Cut and swab method where the trunk is cut as low as possible to the ground and painted (swab) with a registered herbicide within 20 seconds. Mature plants are best controlled by applying herbicides to cut stumps or basal parts of the plant that have been exposed by peeling back the bark. Seedlings and small plants can be treated by herbicide spraying. In all cases, follow-up is important to control resprouting and seedling germination (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Muyt 2001). Direction for controlling Wild Olives (Olea europaea) using the basal bark treatment can be seen at, Government of South Australia (2016). All techniques should be monitored and any regrowth or new seedlings treated via the hand pull, grub, basal or spot spray techniques.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "impact": "Water Dropwort (Oenanthe pimpinelloides) is one of seventeen sleeper weeds identified by the Bureau of Rural Sciences (following consultation with the Australian Weeds Committee) which could have nationally significant impacts on agriculture if allowed to spread.\n\nAgriculture:  Water Dropwort appears to replace pasture species and competes with native species during summer (Government of South Australia 2014). Cunningham & Brown (2006) also report that Water Dropwort has the potential to invade pastures and replace preferred gazing species.  In South Australia in early 2006, Water Dropwort was reported as being limited to one infestation of about 35 hectares (net area) or 84.2 hectares (gross area) where it was impacting on crops and pastures, and at a second site of less than one hectare in Victoria (Cunningham & Brown 2006; Cunningham et al. 2006). Cropping, grazing and horticulture are the land uses potentially at risk from spread of this species in its potential climatic range in southern temperate Australia (CSIRO 2002, in Cunningham & Brown 2006).\n\nThe potential for Water Dropwort to invade pasture and forestry plantations, and its potential to grow in a range of Tasmanian environments, resulted in its listing as a declared weed for that State (DPIPWE Tasmania 2019). The roots are sometimes eaten overseas but caution is required because many species of Oenanthe are poisonous to stock and humans. However, there are no reports of livestock poisoning even though sheep graze on this species. (Cunningham et al. 2003). However, livestock do not usually graze on it, and it has been reported to be poisonous (Government of South Australia 2014).\n\nNative ecosystems: It could also impact on natural ecosystems by out-competing native plants (Kodela 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nUrban areas:  Not known from urban areas, but may be able invade ephemeral riparian areas in urban environments.",
    "controlMethods": "Water Dropwort has been classed as a Category 2 Sleeper Weed recommended for immediate eradication since recent field surveys had been completed (Cunningham & Brown 2006). The feasibility of eradicating the Australian infestations is discussed by Woldendorp & Bomford (2004) and Cunningham & Brown (2006). Larger infestations require an integrated management strategy that could involve herbicide application and the establishment of competitive species as effective control measures (Cooke pers. comm., in Cunningham & Brown 2006). Eradication will also be assisted through awareness programs to recognise and control this weed. Preventing further spread of this weed is the best way of limiting its spread and controlling populations\n\nChemical control: Herbicides that target other broad leaf species could be effective in controlling Water Dropwort, however, care should be taken around water ways or wetlands as these herbicides could be harmful to useful pasture species and are sometimes unsuitable for use around watercourses. Always read and follow the product label. A range of herbicide treatments at the stem elongation stage in spring before autumn sowing of pastures provides effective short-term control with a reduction in Water Dropwort abundance for up to 18 months after sowing of pasture (Mitchell et al. 1995).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Smaller infestations could be removed by hand.\n\nCompetition and management: Water Dropwort is grazed by cattle (Groves & Hosking 1998), which could be part of a control plan. As Water Dropwort has been found to regenerate from seed more densely in unsown plots than in plots of established perennial pasture, so upgrading pastures may be a strategy to reduce the rate of spread by seed. Competition from perennial grasses such as Phalaris and broad-leaved species like white or subterranean clover, reduces seedling survival, therefore maintaining a dense pasture is an effective management strategy. Effective grazing by sheep in winter improves density through tillering of the Phalaris and clover, but cattle may bare the ground by pugging, giving Water Dropwort seedlings sites to establish (Government of South Australia 2014).",

    "habitat": "Serrated Tussock is adapted to a wide range of climates and soil types and is spreading from agricultural areas into metropolitan areas with the area increasing since control techniques have failed to contain its spread.\n\nSerrated Tussock is a very invasive weed that is widespread in southeastern Australia (far northeastern New South Wales south to Victoria and eastern Tasmania), covering more than 1.1 million ha. It is capable of withstanding a range of climates but prefers cool temperate areas with an annual rainfall ranging from 450 – 1000 mm.\n\nAreas affected by Serrated Tussock include, pastures, native grasslands, open scrub and woodland. It will grow on all types of terrain and aspects, from steep, rocky and timbered areas, on low-fertility and dry soils, to fertile moist flats.  It quickly colonises bare ground and disturbed areas such as roadsides, overgrazed pastures or cultivated situations. It will grow in acid soils, but its distribution is limited by salinity and / or water-logging and areas with high summer temperatures (Jacobs & Everett 1993; CRC 2003).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Serrated Tussock is a Weed of National Significance as it is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. In New South Wales alone it has been estimated that the weed has cost more than $40 million in lost production (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: It causes significant problems in grazing lands with poor soil fertility and low rainfall where the benefits of control are marginal. It is also unpalatable to livestock and will only be eaten by sheep and cattle if nothing else is available (Osmond et al. 2008, Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Serrated Tussock has no grazing value because of its high fibre and low protein content. Its low nutritional value is insufficient to meet livestock requirements and if live stock are forced to graze pastures containing only Serrated Tussock, the leaves can form indigestible balls in the rumen, causing loss of condition and eventual death (Osmond et al. 2008). Infestations result in a significant loss in livestock production and and Serrated Tussock probably accounts for a greater reduction in pasture carrying capacity than any other weed in Australia (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Dense infestations may completely dominate pastures, making large areas incapable of supporting livestock. Pastures that can normally carry carry 7-15 dry sheep equivalent (DSE) per hectare (ha) can be reduced to a carrying capacity of only 0.5 DSE per ha. In addition, the seeds with awn can contaminate wool (CRC 2003). Its seeds also contaminate hay and grain and other produce (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nNative ecosystems: Serrated Tussock can readily establish in environmentally significant native grasslands reducing biodiversity as dense infestations can out-compete and eliminate most other plants over large areas, also negatively impacting on native fauna (Osmond et al. 2008; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).  It can also invade other environmental significant area such as grassy woodlands, scelerophyll forest, dry open woodlands, and coastal vegetation (Osmond et al. 2008)\n\nUrban areas: Serrated Tussock can dominate road sides, parks, neglected areas, railways, power-line easements, reserves, and sporting grounds in and around towns and cities (Osmond et al. 2008). In urban areas it creates a fire hazard (CRC 2003), as the build-up of bio-mass increases fire intensity. Seed heads can catch fire, blow away, and start fires some distance away. Seed heads can also block eves causing increased fire risk. Fire season is increased in areas with large infestations.",
    "controlMethods": "Preventing the invasion is the cheapest and most effective way of controlling Serrated Tussock.\n\nChemical control: Serrated Tussock can be killed by several widely used chemicals (Osmond et al. 2008). However, Serrated Tussock is known to have herbicide resistance in some locations in Australia. Herbicide resistance is the ability of a plant to survive and reproduce following application of a herbicide. In addition, herbicide treatment alone that kills target plants will not give long-term control. Spot spraying with a registered herbicide is only effective to control light and scattered infestations with follow-up required.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Only very young plant can be removed by hand-pulling. The extensive root system on mature to adult plants prevents hand-pulling . However, Chipping mature plants out the ground with a mattock before tussocks set seed can kill most plants. However, for large plants where moist soil is present around the remaining roots in the ground, follow-up treatment is required as plant can re-grow from these roots.\n\nCompetition and management: On arable land, Serrated Tussock can be successfully controlled with a program of ploughing, cropping and pasture improvement. Invasion from wind-blown seeds can be reduced by planting windbreaks. Sowing perennial pastures such as Phalaris and improved pastures in general should be established to compete with Serrated Tussock and prevent re-invasion. Stock grazed on Serrated Tussock producing mature seed should be placed in a holding paddock for 10 days before moving them into a clean paddock (CRC 2003) as seeds can remain viable in the stomach of animals for up to 10 days.\n\nMulching, the application of material over the ground such as straw, wood chips, carpet or plastic sheeting will prevent the growth of all plants, including Serrated Tussock and beneficial plants. Suitable for small infestation in native or urban areas, and large infections in agricultural situations.\n\nFire can be used to reduce bio-mass and kill seeds on the plant and soil surface, but will not kill adult plants or buried seed. Fire stimulates re-growth and mass germination of seed so vigorous and planned follow-up is required to control plants.\n\nBiological control: Although Serrated Tussock has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process, there are currently no effective useful biological control agents. Three biological control agents against Serrated Tussock have been investigated for release into Australia: a rust, Puccinia nassellae, a smut, Ustilago spp., and another fungus. A fungus that occurs naturally on native Austrostipa spp. has also been observed to attack Serrated Tussock in the field (CRC 2003), but none of the three agents proved to be a successful candidate for further testing as biological Control agents.\n\nFor further information and detailed methodology of control is outlined in (Osmond et al. 2008) and in various publication on the ‘Victorian Serrated Tussock Working Party’ (2020) web page (http://www.serratedtussock.com/management/fact-sheets)",
    "origin": "There are about 80 species of Nassella in the Americas, with none of the species occurring in Australia native (Everett et al.). Serrated Tussock is native to South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay).",
    "growthForm": "Grass",
    "similarSpecies": "Serrated Tussock  can normally be recognised when fertile seed is present by the combination of the following characters; small wide seed to 1.5-2 mm long without corona (crown separating the seed and awn); awn with off-centre attachment to the seed; thin awn to 25-35 mm long; tussock forming plant with many flowering heads produced mostly within the plant.\n\nSerrated Tussock is similar in general appearance and difficult to distinguish morphologically, when not fertile, from other Nassella species as well as several other native tufted grasses with similar narrow, rolled leaves, such as some species of Austrostipa (previously known as Stipa) or Poa.\n\nThe fine very rough leaves are characteristic of Serrated Tussock, along with a distinctive ligule. A ligule is a small flap located at the junction of the leaf blade and the leaf sheath, located by tracing a leaf down to where it joins the sheath and bending the leaf back at this point. Serrated Tussock has a white, hairless, membranous to papery ligule 0.25-0.5 mm long (or sometimes to 2.5 mm long), whereas most other grasses it can be confused with have ligules with different colours or hairs, or have no visible ligule. Austrostipa scabra (both subspecies falcata and subspecies scabra) has similar ligules but the leaves, while variably hairy, are not distinctly rough (CRC 2003; Everett et al. 2009).",

    "habitat": "Chilean Needle Grass grows in temperate regions with annual rainfall greater than 500 mm. It can thrive in a wide range of soils and conditions from fertile to poorer and degraded soils and has the potential to be very invasive over a large part of the country in both pasture and native vegetation.\n\nAlthough it occurs mainly in pastures and grassy woodlands, on roadsides, and along creeks and rivers, it is increasingly invading native grasslands (CRC 2003). It tolerates drought and heavy grazing (CRC 2003), and is able to establish on even the hardest bare sites on disturbed ground (Jessop et al. 2006).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Chilean Needle Grass (Nassella neesiana) is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. It is closely related to another Weed of National Significance, Serrated Tussock (Nassella trichotoma) (CRC 2003). Chilean Needle Grass affects sown pasture, native grasslands and urban and amenity areas of southern and south-eastern Australia.\n\nAgriculture: It is relatively unpalatable and lower in nutrients than improved pastures, reducing farm productivity by displacing more desirable pasture species. Heavy infestations can decrease productivity by as much as 50% during summer (CRC 2003). It can completely overrun pastures resulting in a canopy cover of up to 60%, which leads to a substantial reduction of stock carrying capacity during late spring and summer when the weed produces large quantities of unpalatable flower stalks (Grech et al. 2004).\n\nThe sharp seeds have a natural twisting mechanism that cause seeds to lodge into fleece, skin, eyes and ears of livestock in response to changes in humidity (Weeds Australia). In New Zealand and eastern states of Australia the seeds have been found to move through the skin and into the body muscles, causing abscesses and downgrading carcasses, and even rendering them unsalable (Weeds Australia, no date). These impacts can significantly affect the value of agricultural products.\n\nNative ecosystems: Chilean Needle Grass is possibly the worst environmental weed threatening endangered indigenous grasslands in south-eastern Australia (Laconis 2004). Chilean Needle Grass can rapidly invade disturbed soils and degraded ecosystems. It is also invading grassy open woodlands and riparian vegetation in many areas. Chilean Needle Grass will out-compete and displace native grasses and herbs, interfere with re-vegetation programs and once established are difficult to manage. Degradation of native habitats including grassland and other habitats will have impacts on native birds and other fauna.\n\nUrban areas:The seeds of Chilean Needle Grass are also known to cause discomfort to dogs and humans, thereby restricting human access in recreational and other areas (Weeds Australia), and is a weed of amenity and neglected areas, parks, gardens, reserves and sporting grounds.",
    "controlMethods": "Chilean Needle Grass is extremely vigorous and competitive. Land managers need to know how to identify it and take prompt action if it is discovered. Management options in established infestations will depend on land use and may include crop rotation, pasture sowing, herbicide control, cultivation,  grazing, and other cultural management options. For best results a combination of options needs to be used (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: Herbicide treatment can be effective. Spot spraying is effective when used on individual plants and small infestations. For large infestations boom spraying as part of integrated weed management techniques can be useful. For up-to-date information on which herbicides are registered to control Chilean Needle Grass and the best application methods and dosages, contact your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au . Permits from state or territory Environment Protection Authorities may be required if herbicides are to be sprayed on riverbanks.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand weeding or chipping is very effective on single plants or small patches. Plants cannot be left to dry in the paddock because of the basal and stem seeds. The whole plant needs to be destroyed.\n\nMowing and slashing may reduce seed set in the flower heads but it can actively disperse stem seeds if machinery is not kept clean. Mowing with a catcher mower during flowering will reduce seed set but it will not remove the basal and stem seeds. Clippings must be burnt and the mower must be thoroughly cleaned before it is used elsewhere (CRC 2003). Maintaining weed-free machinery and equipment is very important in preventing further spread of Chilean Needle Grass. Check machinery moving onto your property and wash down vehicles and machinery in the same area to allow easy follow-up control of any seeds that may germinate. Don’t buy hay, stock feed, or crop and pasture seed from infested areas.\n\nCompetition and management: Control may be achieved using cultivation. Cultivation of the soil encourages seeds to germinate and these can be controlled. Sowing a dense pasture or crop will reduce the amount of Chilean Needle Grass that germinates. Rotational cropping and a mix of cultivation and herbicide application can be used to prevent seedling.\n\nGrazing by animals at the correct time of year when no flowering seed-heads are present can be used. For larger areas larger mobs and a cycle of short duration of high intensity grazing followed by long rest periods offers the benefit of better pasture, fewer weeds and better livestock returns (CRC 2003).  However, Chilean Needle Grass is of lower nutritional value than improved pastures and once it starts flowering the nutritional value decreases further. In addition, the sharp mature seeds attach to animals coats and can penetrate lips, skin and flesh causing harm to animals, downgrading and reducing the values of produce, be it wool or meat.\n\nMulching: Suitable for small infestations in native or urban areas, or larger infections in agricultural situations. Mulching is the the application of material over the ground such as straw, wood chips, carpet or plastic sheeting will prevent the growth of all plants, including weeds and beneficial plants. Organic mulch should be 100 mm thick, regularly topped-up as this reduces over time and used with other control methods to remove any unwanted plants that germinate.\n\nFire: The use of fire has a management tool has been used to burn-off and kill flowering and stem seeds in large infestations.  Other follow up controls methods are required to prevent regrowth and germination of Chilean Needle Grass.\n\nBiological control: Research on the rust fungus Puccinia nassellae was conducted in Argentina to ensure that it is safe and will not attack any other species if released in Australia. It did not prove to be a successful biological control. No useful biological control agents are available in Australia.\n\nWith any of the control programs it is vital to ensure that any Chilean Needle Grass seedlings are prevented from flowering. For further information on management and control of Chilean Needle Grass see Agriculture & Resource Management Council of Australia & New Zealand, Australian & New Zealand Environment & Conservation Council and Forestry Ministers (2000), Muyt (2001), CRC for Australian Weed Management (2003, both references), Dellow (2003), McLaren (2003), Storrie & Lowien (2003), Grech et al. (2004), Pritchard (2004) and Weeds Australia.",
    "origin": "Chilean Needle Grass is native to South and America, including Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil (Sainty & Associates 2002). There are about 80 species of Nassella from the Americas. None of the seven Nassella species occurring in Australia are native (Everett et al. in preparation). It is also naturalised and often a weed in Europe, the Americas, South Africa and New Zealand.",
    "growthForm": "Grass",
    "similarSpecies": "Chilean Needle Grass is similar in appearance to the Native Spear grasses (Austrostipa species). They all have sharp seeds with a long curved or bent awn and hairy tip, and may appear red before drying to a straw colour.\n\nBefore flowering, green leafy plants of Chilean Needle Grass can be mistaken for many other winter-green species, especially Austrostipa, Rytidosperma [as Austrodanthonia] and Festuca. If you look closely, you can see hairs along the leaf surface of Chilean Needle Grass, in contrast to the hairless leaves of Fescue.\n\nChilean Needle Grass also has a small tuft of hairs at the junction of the leaf blade and the leaf sheath which Fescue does not have.\n\nThe leaves of Chilean Needle Grass are much coarser and wider than those of Rytidosperma [as Austrodanthonia] (CRC 2003).\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Chilean Needle Grass seed is the corona (raised crown with small teeth) at the join of the seed body and the awn (CRC 2003). Differences from other Nassella species are illustrated by Jacobs & Everett (1993), Walsh (1994), Wheeler et al. (2002) and Richardson et al. (2006); and Muyt (2001).\n\nSee link: https://www.uppercampaspelandcare.org.au/wp-content/uploads/needle-grass-web-LR-1.pdf",

Large infestations generally form in areas of low intensity management and poor agricultural land (Penhall et al. 2000). Unlike most other Nassella species, N. leucotricha is able to thrive in warmer, drier climates, due to its high water-use efficiency. This attribute was clearly important for its original development, being indigenous to Texas, Oklahoma, and central Mexico",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Texas Needle Grass forms dense infestations in pasture, native grasslands and woodlands where it can exclude desirable species. It has low feed value to stock, and is not palatable so tends to be allowed to increase as long as more palatable pasture species are present (Government of South Australia 2021), considered one of Australia’s worst weeds of native grasslands and pasture. If allowed to spread unchecked it is likely to have major environmental and economic costs (Government of South Australia 2019).\n\nAgriculture: Reduces stock carrying capacity due to the production of masses of unpalatable flower stalks and provides very little leaf material during the warmer months and displaces desirable pasture species during spring and summer. Because the plant is avoided by grazing animals, infestations commonly expand as other species are selectively grazed out. Texas Needle Grass is considered a danger to livestock. The sharp, needle like points on the seeds can damage the eyes and face area and have been known to blind livestock. the sharp seeds penetrates wool, skin and underlying muscle of grazing animals resulting in injury, infection and the downgrading of wool, hides and carcasses (Government of South Australia 2019). Texas Needle Grass is considered a high value pasture crop as it remains green when other pasture is drying up. Stock are removed when the plants are in seed. In Australia the agricultural impact is considered negative due to the high invasive potential, loss of grazing land as well as the financial cost and time involved in removing this hardy weed species (Penhall et al. 2000; Magee 2005).\n\nNative ecosystems: Biodiversity values are negatively affected by Texas Needle Grass through direct completion with native grassland species. It is considered one of the 49 non-native species that have a direct impact on Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) rated rare or threatened plants within Victoria (Groves et al. 2003; Obst 2004). In native grasslands it displaces native forbs and grasses such as kangaroo grass and spear grass (Government of South Australia 2019).",

There are three other Nassella species, found in the same area as Texas Needle Grass, that also have a corona. These are Chilean Needle Grass (Nassella neesiana), Lobed Needle Grass (Nassella charruana) and Cane Needle Grass (Nassella hyalina or Nassella formicarum). Expert advice should be sought when trying to distinguish between these species as variation within each species may lead to incorrect identification (McLaren et al. 1998; Muyt 2001; Navie 2004).\n\nDistinguishing between grass species can be extremely difficult. The use of field guides with line drawings and/or photographs is recommended as well as the use of hand lenses or microscopes. Any samples being sent away for expert analysis, e.g. to a state herbarium, ideally need to have complete seed heads containing seeds as well as leaves for correct identification.",

    "habitat": "Cane Needle Grass is found in a variety of habitats, usually on fertile soils, including black volcanic soils and grey cracking clays on basalt near Melbourne (CRC 2003), and requires 500 mm of annual rainfall or more (Humphries & Florentine 2021).\n\nLike many other Stipoid grasses, Nassella species often invade sites that are already highly degraded, especially land with higher fertility soil that has been used for grazing or farming (CRC 2003). In addition to growing in pastures and weedy areas on grassland plains, Cane Needle Grass has invaded open woodlands and native grasslands. It has also been observed growing in areas subject to seasonal waterlogging and in riparian vegetation (McLaren et al. 1998).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Cane Needle Grass is on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 non-native plants that threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage. Although only in the early stages of establishment, these weeds have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: Although not currently seen as a threat to agriculture, Cane Needle Grass could have a serious impact on agricultural production in the future. It is drought tolerant and forms dense, competitive infestations. It is closely related to Serrated Tussock, a Weed of National Significance, which costs south-eastern Australia's grazing industries more than $40 million annually in control and lost production. Several species of Nassella have proved difficult to control and are now environmental and agricultural weeds (CRC 2003). Besides loss of production and environmental damage, the sharp seeds of Nassella species can damage sheep skins and carcasses and contaminate fleeces (CRC 2003). While some reports describe it as palatable to stock and suitable as reasonable fodder, Cane Needle Grass is also described as quite sparse with only intermediate feed value (CRC 2003).\n\nNative ecosystems: Cane Needle Grass threatens a number of conservation reserves west of Melbourne. It appears to be spreading, especially in wetter areas within open native grasslands. It has the potential to affect the biodiversity of riverbank vegetation and grassland, especially in areas that remain wet for long periods (CRC 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Early detection and eradication of Cane Needle Grass are important to prevent infestations of Cane Needle Grass, that currently has a limited distribution. Small infestations can be easily eradicated if they are detected early but continuing surveillance is needed to ensure no re-infestations occur (CRC 2003). Because there are few Cane Needle Grass infestations, and it can potentially be eradicated before it becomes established, any new outbreaks should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Do not try to control Cane Needle Grass without their expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003). No formal observations or trials investigating control methods have been conducted on Cane Needle Grass, but where it occurs in native grasslands there are some general principles that apply.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: The ideal removal method involves digging out the whole plan. Hand weeding or chipping is very effective on single plants or small patches, making sure to first cut and bag any flowering seeds or stem seeds. Plants cannot be left to dry in the paddock because any basal cleistogenes (stem seeds) may germinate if left. The whole plant needs to be destroyed.\n\nMowing and slashing may reduce seed set in the flower heads but it can actively disperse stem seeds if machinery is not kept clean. Mowing with a catcher mower during flowering will reduce seed set but it will not remove the basal cleistogenes (stem seeds). Clippings must be burnt and the mower must be thoroughly cleaned before it is used elsewhere (CRC 2003). Maintaining weed-free machinery and equipment is very important in preventing further spread of Cane Needle Grass. Check machinery moving onto your property and wash down vehicles and machinery in the same area to allow easy follow-up control of any seeds that may germinate. Don't buy hay, stock feed, or crop and pasture seed from infested areas. When controlling large infestations, mowing during the peak flowering period can be effective when followed up with additional mowing, timed to remove new flowers, as the plants will re-flower within two to six weeks. Mowing will not destroy infestations but can held reduce the spread of seed.\n\nCompetition and management: Control may be achieved using cultivation. Cultivation of the soil encourages seeds to germinate and these can be controlled. Sowing a dense pasture or crop will reduce the amount of Cane Needle Grass that germinates. Rotational cropping and a mix of cultivation and herbicide application can be used to prevent seedling.\n\nHeavy intense grazing by animals at the correct time of year when no flowering seed-heads are present can be used.  It has only intermediate feed value to stock which are likely to avoid the plant when more palatable pasture species are present.  For larger areas larger mobs and a cycle of short duration of high intensity grazing followed by long rest periods offers the benefit of better pasture, fewer weeds and better livestock returns (CRC 2003). In addition, the sharp mature seeds attach to animals coats and can penetrate lips, skin and flesh causing harm to animals, downgrading and reducing the values of produce, be it wool or meat.\n\nMulching: Suitable for small infestations in native or urban areas, or larger infections in agricultural situations. Mulching is the the application of material over the ground such as straw, wood chips, carpet or plastic sheeting will prevent the growth of all plants, including weeds and beneficial plants. Organic mulch should be 100 mm thick, regularly topped-up as this reduces over time and used with other control methods to remove any unwanted plants that germinate.\n\nFire: The use of fire has a management tool has been used to burn-off and kill flowering and stem seeds in large infestations. Fire can be effective in areas with natives grassed and other Nassella species. A fire timed to encourage native grass growth can be used for competitive exclusion and targeted spot spraying (Muyt 2001). Other follow up controls methods are required to prevent regrowth and germination of seed\n\nChemical control: Herbicide use can be successful if effective competition from native grass species has been established to overcome the large seedbank of Nassella species (CRC 2003). Spot spraying is effective when used on individual plants and small infestations, and is used as a follow-up for other management practices to control any possible cleistogenes (stem seeds) (Muyt 2001). For up-to-date information on which herbicides are registered to control Cane Needle Grass and the best application methods and dosages, contact your state or territory weed management agency or local council.\n\nAlso see; DPI NSW (2019);  the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nPermits from state or territory Environment Protection Authorities may be required if herbicides are to be sprayed on riverbanks.",
    "origin": "Cane Needle Grass is native to Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay (CRC 2003).",
    "growthForm": "Grass",
    "similarSpecies": "Cane Needle Grass is hard to identify because of its similarity to native spear grasses (Austrostipa species) and other Nassella species. They all have sharp seeds with a long curved or bent awn and hairy tip. However, Nassella species have strongly overlapping margins of the 'lemma' (the seed coat), which make it difficult to open the mature seeds. Also, the seeds of most Nassella species (except Serrated Tussock) possess a corona, a raised crown at the joining of the seed body and the tail (the awn). The corona is absent in Austrostipa species (CRC 2003). Introduced Nassella species have a membranous ligule (a small flap at the junction of the leaf blade and leaf sheath) whereas native species either have no ligule or the ligule is fringed with hairs (Muyt 2001; McLaren et al. 1998; Navie 2004; Best 2008).\n\nDifferences between Cane Needle Grass and similar looking species are illustrated by CRC (2003) and Richardson et al. (2006). Plant identification keys for the species of Nassella occurring in New South Wales are provided by Jacobs & Everett (1993) and Wheeler et al. (2002); VicFlora 2016.\n\nQueensland Goverenemt (2016) states that the species can be distinguished by the following differences:\n\nCane needle grass (Nassella hyalina) has seeds with relatively short awns (20–45 mm long) and a short corona (less than 1.5 mm long). Its flower spikelets are relatively small (5–12 mm long) and it produces stem seeds (i.e. cleistogenes).\n\nLobed needle grass (Nassella charruana) has seeds with relatively long awns (more than 45 mm long) and a long corona (5–6 mm long). Its flower spikelets are relatively large (16–20 mm long) and it does not produce stem seeds (i.e. cleistogenes).\n\nChilean needle grass (Nassella neesiana) has seeds with relatively long awns (more than 45 mm long) and a short corona (less than 1.5 mm long). Its flower spikelets are relatively large (10–22 mm long) and it produces stem seeds (i.e. cleistogenes).\n\nTexas needle grass (Nassella leucotricha) has seeds with relatively long awns (more than 45 mm long) and a moderately-sized corona (1.5–2.5 mm long). Its flower spikelets are relatively large (10–17 mm long) and it produces stem seeds (i.e. cleistogenes).\n\nShort-spined needle grass (Nassella megapotamia) has seeds with relatively long awns (more than 45 mm long) and a short corona (less than 1.5 mm long). Its flower spikelets are relatively small (7–10 mm long) and it does not produce stem seeds (i.e. cleistogenes).\n\nSeveral other introduced grasses are relatively similar. These include serrated tussock (Nassella trichotoma), Mexican feathergrass (Nassella tenuissima), broad kernel espartillo (Amelichloa caudata), narrow kernel espartillo (Achnatherum brachychaeta), plumerillo (Jarava plumosa) and Uruguayan ricegrass (Piptochaetium montevidense). None of these species have collars (i.e. coronas) on their seeds.",

It is drought tolerant and forms dense infestations. While cattle may be able to tolerate Lobed Needle Grass, it is a major problem for sheep because the sharp seeds can damage skins and carcasses and contaminate fleeces. As seen with the closely related Serrated Tussock and Chilean Needle Grass, infestations of Lobed Needle Grass would result in significant loss in livestock production (CRC 2003). Nassella charruana shares the unpalatability traits of N. trichotoma and also the injurious seeds of N. neesiana, and within its native range, this species is considered highly competitive, even displacing other Nassella species. For these reasons, N. charruana poses a significant threat to temperate rangelands, particularly those with high rainfall and soil fertility Humphries & Florentine (2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Lobed Needle Grass is a successful competitor with native grasses and is impacting on native grasslands and open woodlands. Lobed needle grass forms dense competitive infestations. In Victoria (only state with this weed) it has invaded open woodlands and native and introduced grasslands including grassland dominated by other Nassella species",

The corona is absent from Austrostipa species (CRC 2003) and Austrostipa and Poa species either lack ligules on their leaves, or have ligules that are fringed with hairs (Queensland Governemnt 2016).\n\nIn Lobed Needle Grass the corona is much longer than in most other Nassella species and is about 3.5 mm long. If not in seed, the ligule can be used to assist in identifying Lobed Needle Grass; it is short (about 1 mm), transparent and has only a few short hairs (CRC 2003). Queensland Government (2016) list the differences between introduced Nassella species as:\n\nLobed Needlegrass (Nassella charruana) has seeds with relatively long awns (more than 45 mm long) and a long corona (5–6 mm long).

Control by environmental modification through water level management (i.e. fluctuations with periodic lowering and raising of water levels) can be used to reduce aquatic weed growth. Excess growth of Eurasian Water Milfoil has been managed overseas with regular changes in water level and use of approved herbicide treatments, but this technique must be used with caution to avoid negative impacts on desirable species and native habitats (Smith 1971; Sainty & Jacobs 1981, 2003).\n\nChemical control: Eurasian Water Milfoil is susceptible to some herbicides but regrowth is fast. If plants are not killed repeated control will be necessary (Crowell 1999; Weber 2003).

Parrot's Feather has distinctive glaucous (blue-green with a whitish bloom) leaves on shoots that emerge above the water surface. Unlike Eurasian Water Milfoil, the plants of Parrot's Feather only have female flowers in Australia (Orchard 1986; EPPO 2008). The native Watermilfoil (Myriophyllum salsugineum) has finely divided submerged leaves similar to those of Eurasian Water Milfoil, but it also has undivided reddish purple emergent leaves (Sainty & Jacobs 2003).\n\nEurasian Water Milfoil can also be confused with submerged growth of Hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum), which is a free-floating aquatic. Its leaves are not comb-like or feathery as in Eurasian Water Milfoil or Parrot's Feather, but narrowly branched or forked 2-4 times (Sainty & Jacobs 2003; Auckland Regional Council 2008).",

It grows in water up to 2 m deep, rooting in mud or gravel, and often extending onto the adjacent saturated banks. It can persist on saturated substrates when water levels drop. It is tolerant of a wide temperature range (thriving in water between 8 °C and 30 °C) and grows best in water containing high levels of nitrogen. Parrot's Feather grows principally in warm-temperate and subtropical, mainly coastal regions; especially near urban areas (Aston 1973; Orchard 1986, 1990; Romanowski 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty & Jacobs 2004; EPPO 2008).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Parrot's Feather forms dense stands that impede water flow, blocking small creeks, drains and channels. Infestations have negative impacts on the environment, biodiversity, native flora and fauna, transport, recreation, and tourism (Orchard 1986; Thorp & Wilson 1998 -; Sainty & Associates 2004; Richardson et al. 2006).\n\nAgriculture: Aquatic weeds such as Parrot's Feather have detrimental economic impacts related to interference with the flow of irrigation water, hydroelectric power production (floating mats can block intakes, pumps and metering devices), transport, fisheries, recreation, and increased health hazards. It can invade rice fields, affecting crop yield (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: While Parrot's Feather may provide cover for some aquatic organisms, it can seriously change physical (e.g. reducing light) and chemical characteristics of water bodies. Infestations alter aquatic ecosystems by shading out algae that are the basis of the aquatic food chain. Dense stands displace and exclude native water plant species, reducing the natural biological diversity, as has been observed in nutrient-enriched coastal or brackish water conditions (Weber 2003; EPPO 2008).",
    "controlMethods": "Prevention: Preventing the introduction and spread of Parrot's Feather is the best means of weed control. Care should be taken to prevent further imports into Australia because, if male plants become established, seeds could be produced and increase the risk of spread (Sainty & Jacobs 2003).\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual control: Physical control by mechanical cutting is usually not effective because plants rapidly regrow from fragmented stems, however biomass harvesting may be possible. Hand pulling, subsurface cutting, and use of draglines may give useful temporary control, but it is essential to minimise the movement of stem fragments. Any material removed must be disposed of carefully. In small dams it has been successfully controlled by covering the water with black plastic sheeting for several weeks (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Weber 2003; EPPO 2008).\n\nChemical control: In general, herbicides give effective control in most situations. Herbicides must be approved for use in aquatic environments (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Peirce & Pratt 2002; Weber 2003; EPPO 2008).\n\nSee the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

It is also a weed of pastures, cultivated land and disturbed areas (Herbicide 2021), and is reported to occur in a variety of native variegation (Agriculture Victoria 2021).\n\nAgriculture: Muskweed competes strongly with cereals and winter annual broad-leaf crops such as chickpeas, canola, lupins, faba beans, field peas and is particularly problematic in pulse crops, with yield losses of up to 50% being reported (Holding et al. 2006) in western Victoria and South Australia. It is also a contaminant reducing value and marketability of seed and hay, and may cause blockages of machinery during harvest (Government of South Australia 2021). It is a host to Plasmodiophora brassicae (Clubroot), a persistent and devastating disease of cruciferous (Brassicaceae) crops (Donald 2006). It has the potential to become a major and widespread weed species, particularly on the heavier textured soils of northern New South Wales and Queensland (Dellow et al. 2006). It is considered a major emerging weed problem in Victoria, especially on the heavier textured soils of the Wimmera region (Dellow et al. 2006). In Australia, it has probably not reached the limit of its spread (Storrie 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: It also invades some native vegetation types and in Victoria including woodlands, semiarid woodlands Mallee as listed in Agriculture Victoria (2021).\n\nUrban areas: Not known from urbans areas, although could establish if transported on machinery or vehicles as this weeds responds to the types of disturbance common of urban areas and roadsides.",
    "controlMethods": "Infestations of Muskweed (Myagrum perfoliatum) should be the target of integrated weed management as herbicide control options are limited. Various management tactics incorporate crop choice, farm hygiene and herbicide applications (Holding et al. 2006).\n\nChemical control:   Muskweed can be difficult and expensive to control once established in cropping land, where both an early post-emergent spray and late selective spray-topping may be necessary each year. In South Australia, there are few herbicides registered for cereals or fallows and it is tolerant to many herbicides commonly-used in these situations. There are no herbicide registrations for selective control in broad-leaf crops (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Not normally used but individual or small patches of young plants can be chipped out.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation effectively controls seedlings but must be repeated regularly for several years. Crop infested areas after cultivation with late sown wheat, planted at a high rate, and use a pre emergent herbicide.\nCompetition and management: Graze pastures heavily in spring to reduce seed set. Shorter fallows, continuous cropping and broad-leaved crops in the rotation favour Muskweed.",

    "habitat": "Two-leaf Cape Tulip is found in temperate, sub-tropical and semi-arid regions. It occurs on a range of soil types and prefers sunny locations. It occurs as a weed of grazing land mostly in areas with annual rainfall of less than 600 mm. It does not establish well on shaded site. Two-leaf Cape Tulip will invade dry coastal, heathland and heathy woodland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, freshwater wetland vegetation, roadsides, parks, disturbed sites, waste areas and crops (Carr et al. 1992; Navie 2004).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: All parts of Two-leaf Cape Tulip are toxic to all types of grazing animals. The poison is a glycoside which causes loss of appetite, weakness and depression, blindness, dysentery, scouring and paralysis of the hind legs. Death usually occurs within 3 days and treatment is charcoal or kaolin to absorb the poison. Stock accustomed to grazing on infestations are not affected as they know not to eat the plants. This results in desirable pasture species being replaced by Two-leaf Cape Tulip through selective grazing, decreasing carrying capacity of the pasture. Patches can be very dense with almost 7 000 corms per square metre recorded in some areas (DPI 2007; Animal and Plant Control Commission 2000).\n\nNative ecosystems: Two-leaf Cape Tulip invades native habitats and has the potential to be a weed of conservation importance. In Western Australia it is a weed of woodlands, granite rocks and limestone heaths throughout the south-west. It severely impedes the growth and regeneration of native ground-flora (Hussey et al. 1997; Muyt 2001; CSIRO Entomology 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Prevention: Prevention of establishment of Two-leaf Cape Tulip is the most effective control method. Care should be taken to not buy hay containing Two-leaf Cape Tulip. Machinery dirty from work in affected areas should be washed down before being moved to uninfested areas (Hawkins et al. 2007).\n\nIn general, control methods for Two-leaf Cape Tulip are similar to those of one-leaf Cape tulip.\n\nNon-chemical control: Two-leaf Cape Tulip can be effectively controlled in arable land and permanent pasture, but a carefully planned long term management program carried out over several years is required. In planning such programs integrated management strategies will achieve the best results. Early treatment of new infestations and small patches should be a priority. Control is complicated by dormancy of the corms and seeds. Only a limited proportion of plants grow in any one season. Control of these plants will not affect dormant corms. Any control program in agricultural situations should commence with cultivation or burning in late summer or early autumn to encourage the sprouting of dormant corms (Funston & Faithfull 1999).\n\nSingle individuals and small numbers of plants should be dug out and the corms and fruit destroyed by burning or immersion in boiling water (Funston & Faithfull 1999).\n\nCultivation is probably less effective for controlling Two-leaf Cape Tulip than One-leaf Cape tulip, because of the numerous small cormils formed around the main corm and in the leaf bases. Killing the main corm by cultivation will not affect the cormils and the cormils survive for longer than the seeds of one-leaf Cape tulip.\n\nChemical control: There is also a difference in herbicide susceptibility with Two-leaf Cape Tulip susceptible over a longer period from corm transition to early flowering (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nBiological control: Two-leaf Cape Tulip has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Cape tulips are suitable targets for biological control because there are few close relatives among Australian native species and no related crops. Potential agents identified include weevils feeding on corms and Urodon species that feed on seeds. The most promising potential agent at present is the rust fungus Puccinia moraeae Syd. which affects the leaves (CSIRO Entomology 2007).",

This occurs when the old corms have shrivelled appreciably and the new corm at the base of the stem is not yet fully developed. The corm transition stage lasts approximately two weeks and usually occurs in June or July, with variation from year to year. Cultivate to a depth of at least 15 cm or to the depth of the deepest corm to kill most plants. Repeat after four weeks to kill surviving plants and again when necessary for at least four years until the dormant seeds and corms are exhausted (Funston & Faithfull 1999).\n\nChemical control: Cape Tulip can be effectively and economically controlled with herbicide treatment repeated over several seasons. It is most effective when the plant is just about to flower or has just begun to flower. Treatment must be undertaken annually to reduce the population of Cape Tulip. One season without treatment may allow the problem to worsen (Funston & Faithfull 1999).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nBiological control: One-leaf Cape Tulip has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process.

    "impact": "Giant Sensitive Plant is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nAgriculture: Giant Sensitive Plant forms dense stands that replace all native vegetation on the ecologically and economically valuable wetlands of the Top End of northern Australia. Giant Sensitive Plant invasion threatens the production, cultural and conservation values of wetlands, and reduces the scope for exploitation of resources by land users. Pastoralists are affected because the inedible and thorny Giant Sensitive Plant smothers and replaces grasslands, blocks access to stock watering points and hinders mustering. Additionally, the harvesting of bush foods by indigenous people is hampered by Giant Sensitive Plant (CRC 2003).\n\nNative ecosystems: In environmental terms, nationally and internationally significant wetlands are threatened by Giant Sensitive Plant, which reduces the biodiversity of plant and animal life on the floodplains by out-competing native plants and reducing available habitat for native animals. Although currently limited in distribution, if left unchecked Giant Sensitive Plant has the potential to dominate wetlands across the whole of northern Australia (CRC 2003).\n\nCultural: Giant Sensitive Plant infestations can reduce access to areas for fishing and recreation. This is especially important as it affects the ability of indigenous groups to participate in cultural hunting and food collection such as turtles, water lilies and water chestnuts (Australian Government 2009). It also reduces accessibility to some indigenous sacred and cultural sites.\n\nA more detailed analysis of the impact of Giant Sensitive Plant on the environment is available in Walden et al. (2004).",
    "controlMethods": "Preventing the introduction of and spread of Giant Sensitive Plant is the most effective and cheapest way of control (Australian Government 2009). Its seeds are easily spread and so implementing a hygiene program of people, vehicles, machinery and animals that have entered infested areas will help to slow the spread. Seed can easily be trapped in tyres, wheels and radiator grills\n\nChemical control: Larger sites can be sprayed with herbicides, and can be effective in eradicating Giant Sensitive Plant if enough time and resources are allocated. Herbicide is most effective when the plant is in its active growth phase (Australian Government 2009). Chemicals can be applied either by foliar or aerial spraying. Continuous use of chemicals on plants can lead to herbicide resistance.\n\nNon-chemical control: Small outbreaks of Giant Sensitive Plant can be controlled by simple hand-pulling and grubbing. Note that because of seed-longevity – perhaps as much as 23 years in sandy soil but usually much shorter (Lonsdale et al. 1995) – it is necessary to revisit sites on a regular basis. Mechanical clearing of large infestations can occur after herbicide application. Chaining and chopper-rolling can also be used to clear large infestations.\n\nStrategic use of fire can also be effective. This is most effective if the plants are treated with herbicide first. If not 90% of mature plants and 50% of seedlings can regrow after fire (Australian Government 2009). Fire can be used to stimulate seed germination that is then sprayed with chemicals.\n\nBiological control: Long-term biological control offers the only cost-effective control of very large infestations. Since 1983 at least 13 insect and two fungal species have been released on Giant Sensitive Plant in Australia, with the most recent introduction – March 2007 – being a tiny beetle, Nesaecrepida infuscata, which attacks roots and leaves of the plant (Anon. 2007).\n\nFor more information on control methods, including details of biological control agents see, for example, Harley (1992), Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001), CRC for Weed Management (2003) and various papers in Julien et al. (2004).\n\nFor general information of the use of chemicals please visit the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority at http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "similarSpecies": "Giant Sensitive Plant is most likely to be confused with other species of the genus, Mimosa diplotricha and M. pudica all three having touch-sensitive leaflets and pink globular heads of flowers.\n\nMimosa diplotricha is a scrambling sub-shrub with long hairs and numerous prickles to 3 mm long (unlike Mimosa which has scattered and 5-12 mm long prickles) on 4-angled (not rounded) stems. Its seed pods are generally shorter and narrower and break into only 3-5 one-seeded segments rather than14-26 segments. The common sensitive plant differs from both of these species in that the leaves lack thorns and arise from one point rather than being arranged in pairs along the axis.\n\nGiant Sensitive Plant also has some resemblance to other weedy Fabaceae such as Acacia farnesiana but are distinguished by not having sensitive leaves. The Coffee Bush (Leucaena leucocephala) superficially resembles Mimosa but it does not have prickles or sensitive leaves and its globular flower heads are creamy yellow.\n\nFor a more detailed comparison of the species of Mimosa and descriptions of other members of the Mimosoideae (Fabaceae) in Australia see Cowan (1998).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: Creeping Sensitive Plant is an aggressive weed which chokes out cane and other crops, as well as tropical pastures. It grows faster than sugarcane, sending out long spiny stems which quickly smother the crops, not only reducing the yield but also fouling mechanical harvesters. It is unpalatable to stock and, because of its spiny nature, is not trampled by them. In consequence, it tends to smother pastures, its spiny stems producing tangled thickets in which trapped animals die and man can be seriously injured. Tens of thousands of hectares of Queensland's tropical pastures are now infested with Creeping Sensitive Plant and it is potentially one of the most serious weeds of sugarcanes and pastures on the wet tropical coast of Queensland. Although normally not touched by stock a form of this plant (Mimosa diplotricha var. inversa) is palatable and eaten by cattle. It may be toxic to sheep and a report from the Indonesian island of Flores suggests Giant Sensitive Plant is toxic to pigs (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Creeping Sensitive Plant is not easily controlled by cultivation, or cutting and burning of mature plants as they regrow rapidly from the crown, and seeds in the soil readily germinate after aerial growth is removed. There is also the practical problem of access to infested areas if fields are waterlogged. However, if access is available, seedlings can be controlled through cultivation and regular slashing of mature plants, which prevents them from seeding (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nCreeping Sensitive Plant has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control agents have been trialled for this species, including two Brazilian insects specific to the plant. Of these, a sap-feeding bug called Heteropsylla spinulosa has been found to drastically reduce the vigour and seeding of plants. A native, stem-spotting fungus called Corynespora cassiicola also causes defoliation and dieback in hot humid conditions (Land Protection 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",

Miconia is currently growing on the margins of north Queensland rainforests and has the potential to spread in remote areas. It is well suited to the climate of coastal north Queensland and represents a serious threat to coastal tropical and tropical rainforests. If allowed to become firmly established it could form extensive, monospecific stands, displacing native flora and fauna and creating deep shaded which prevents regeneration of native plants (Loope 1997; Csurhes & Edwards 1998; Galway 2006; Meyer 2006).\n\nThe tentacular root system is also suspected to favour soil erosion and landslides (Meyer 2006).",

    "impact": "Agriculture: Tufted honeyflower (Melianthus comosus) can invade degraded pastures and reduce productivity. All parts of Tufted Honeyflower are extremely toxic to stock and humans, although due to its unpleasant odour seems to deter animals from grazing it at any stage. If it is consumed death occurs quickly. Dense clumps restrict animal movement and reduce pasture production while providing shelter for pests. It can also divert stream flow if growing in water courses. The flowers are attractive to bees which produce a dark, possibly poisonous honey (Parson & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Can grow in degraded open vegetation, grasslands and open bushland, reducing biodiversity while providing shelter for pests.\n\nHuman impacts: Tufted Honeyflower could also potentially affect human recreation by blocking access on land and in water (Victorian Resources Online 2007).\n\nWhat to do if a person is poisoned:\n\nIf the patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nIf the patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.\n\nThis species has been valued in Africa and Europe the past for its medicinal properties (Parson & Cuthbertson 2001).",

Individual plants can also be removed near ground level and the fresh wound painted with herbicide (cut and paint technique), however follow up treatment with herbicide will be needed to address any regrowth. Herbicides that are residual in the soil have shown some effectiveness in killing plants without any physical treatment (Parson & Cuthbertson 2001; Wyndham City Council 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

It commonly occurs in waste places such as along fence lines, roadsides and channel banks, around buildings and sheep camps and sometimes colonies bare eroded ground. It also invades disturbed sites in natural bush-land (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Conn 1999; CRC 2000; Government of South Australia 2021).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: Horehound is a major pasture weed. It causes wool quality losses due to contamination by burrs. It is not palatable to stock and is therefore favoured by heavy grazing which reduces competition by palatable plant species. This leads to plants of Horehound occupying large areas of pasture and a considerable reduction in the area available for stock grazing. If animals are forced to eat it due to a lack of alternative feed their meat and milk are tainted (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Conn 1999).\n\nNative ecosystems: Horehound is also a very serious threat to natural ecosystems, especially if they have been disturbed, overgrazed or previously grazed by sheep. It invades a range of indigenous vegetation types including dry coastal vegetation, mallee shrubland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland and vegetation on rock outcrops (Carr et al. 1992; CRC 2000) from temperate to semi arid environments.",
    "controlMethods": "Control of Horehound requires a combination of different techniques for best results.\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual removal is suitable only for small patches because it is so labour intensive. Larger infestations can be burned to stimulate seed germination and the resulting plants ploughed and buried before they flower (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; CRC 2000).\n\nChemical control: A range of herbicides are considered suitable for control of this weed for various application marthods, see (CRC 2000; DPI, NSW 2019; Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA 2018; DiTomaso, et al. 2013; Government of South Australia 2021; HerbiGuide 2021). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for further chemical information.\n\nBiological control: Horehound has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Four insect species have so far been identified as potential biological control agents. Two of these have already been released, the Horehound Plume Moth Wheeleria spilodactylus and the Horehound Clearwing Moth Chamaesphecia mysiniformis. Wheeleria has established well and its leaf-eating caterpillars are producing good results in terms of biomass and seed reduction (CRC 2000; CSIRO European Laboratory 2001).",

Not normally associated with native vegetation although it does occur in native ecosystems in some areas.",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: Alkali Sida is a deep-rooted perennial that competes strongly with pastoral species, especially on alkaline soils. It is thought to impact especially on irrigated annual pastures, and restricts growth and replaces biomass in these areas, as it can form large, dense colonies (California Department of Food and Agriculture 2007). However the current area of infestation in Australia is small, probably has only a minor impact on crop yield, and is not thought to affect land value (Agriculture Victoria 2021; Parsons 1973; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). However, overseas experience suggests that it could compete strongly with irrigated pastures if introduced to this system (Government of South Australia 2021). Although usually avoided by grazing livestock, Alkali Sida can be toxic in large quantities to sheep due to formation of hairball blockages in the intestines (Hill 1993; California Department of Food and Agriculture 2007: Lamp & Collet 1976).\n\nNative ecosystems: This species may have a minor impact on the flora strata in grassland communities, and potentially reduce the food source of some native fauna. However, it is not currently known to invade many native areas apart from riparian areas and riverine grassy woodland and grasslands (Agriculture Victoria 2021).",
    "controlMethods": "The best and only methods of control are repeated application of herbicides during active growth before flowering to deplete the large underground roots.\n\nNon-chemical control: While the above-ground vegetation of Alkali Sida dies off in autumn, the root system can be extensive in the soil. The removal of above-ground parts by cultivation is not effective, as resprouting occurs from the root system. Furthermore, excessive cultivation may spread the plant. This species is not readily grazed by livestock, and therefore grazing can encourage its spread due to the removal of competitive species (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Alkali Sida is considered to be moderately palatable to goats, which may be useful for the control of this species in pastoral areas (Meat & Livestock Australia 2007).\n\nChemical control: The only currently effective control is by herbicides, which should be applied before flowering and during active growth (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Agriculture Victoria 2021). It can be controlled by repeated spot spraying with an appropriate herbicide. Costs are minor for the small infestations in the state, but the herbicide used on Alkali Sida cannot be applied close to vines or horticultural crops due to potential for vapour drift (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "Alkali Sida is native to western and southern North America. It has some importance as an agricultural weed in California, Utah and Texas (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001), and is a declared weed in California and Arizona (as Sida hederacea) (GRIN 2007). It is widely distributed in California, and can be problematic in grain and cotton crops and orchards, and often occurs on disturbed sites (Robbins et al. 1970; Parsons 1973).  Outside of the Americas it has only known to have established as a weed in Australia (USDA 2021).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "African Boxthorn is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. All parts of African Boxthorn (fruit, leaves, stem and roots) are poisonous to people, livestock and other animal species, although the level of risk is believed to be low (Noble and Rose 2013).\n\nAgriculture: African Boxthorn can spread quickly if left unchecked. Having established it can rapidly form impenetrable, spiny thickets reducing stock movement and also the land available for pasture. Since birds are often the dispersing agent, infestations are commonly found around the base of taller trees. The fruit of African Boxthorn is a breeding ground for insect pests such as fruit fly, dried fruit beetles and tomato fly (Land Protection 2006). The taproot of the weed must be removed for control purposes otherwise it may produce re-growth, or if it is killed, it may still remain a hazard to stock and tyres because of its hardness and persistence (Land Protection 2006). The plant becomes a nuisance along fences, creeks,  and around dams and leaking troughs where it blocks passage along roads and prevents stock access to watering points. Leaves may be toxic to poultry (Noble and Rose 2013). Impenetrable thickets are sometimes regarded as shelter for livestock (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nNative ecosystems: African Boxthorn also impacts the natural environment, e.g. displacing native vegetation and degrading fauna habitat.  Dense infestations may provide a haven for feral animals such as rabbits, sparrows (Land Protection 2006) foxes, feral pigs (Sus scrofa) and starlings (Noble and Rose 2013). However, impenetrable thickets are often cited as havens for small native birds and animals. Where African Boxthorn infests coastal areas and offshore islands it can significantly alter and interfere with native fauna habitats and has becomes the only woody plant present, changing the vegetation structure (Noble and Rose 2013). On islands off South Australia and Western Australia, African Boxthorn displaces the native shrub Nitraria billardieri, which is used by seals (Arctocephalus spp.) to shelter their pups. African Boxthorn does not provide an equivalent nursery habitat, leaving pups more vulnerable to predation. On islands inhabited by Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea), such as East Beagle Island off the coast of Western Australia, African Boxthorn grows down to the beach and is known to impede the sea lions’ access to the island for pupping. It also impacts various sea birds and birds have become entangled in the woody spiny plant and died.\n\nUrban areas: Invades areas on urban fringes and abandon land and can forms impenetrable stands for people.",
    "controlMethods": "African Boxthorn (Lycium ferocissimum) is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS) in Australia due to its invasiveness, impacts, potential for spread and effects on socio-economic and environmental values. Several chemical and mechanical control methods are effective for managing African Boxthorn.\n\nChemical control: Chemicals (herbicides) can be used to control African Boxthorn.\n\nFoliar sprays: can be applied when the plants are actively growing in spring or after rain when the plant is actively growing with follow-up in autumn. As the plant has a remarkably resilient rootstock, and will readily shed its leaves when under stress, foliar spraying does not produce such reliable results as it does for some other weed species.\n\nBasal bark treatment:  spraying around the base of stems for plant up to around 50 mm in diameter to a height of 30-40 cm above ground level.\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface.\n\nRoot application: is when a residual herbicide can be applied to the soil between the base of the plant and the drip-line, usually when the soil is wet or rain is expected (Land Protection 2006), and is normally used where there are no native plants to be affected.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au , DPI NSW (2019) and (Noble and Rose 2013).\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nPhysical control:  Manual (hand) removal is only possible when plants are small seedlings. Some Mechanical (machine removal) control of African Boxthorn is possible but there is likely to be re-growth from soil seed stores or from the taproot, meaning that cultivation and/or herbicides may need to be the next step. Mechanical control of Boxthorn is best done when the plant is not carrying fruit or seed; otherwise, fresh seed is likely to be deposited into freshly disturbed soil. Suitable mechanical techniques for managing African Boxthorn include the following:\n\nWinching – involves pulling or winching (for example with a tractor and chain) can be used to remove large plants in difficult-to-access or fragile areas (such as coastal dunes).\n\nPulling or plucking – involves grabbing and lifting the plants mechanically with a front-end loader, articulated loader or excavator and is useful for treating light to moderate infestations and minimises impacts on surrounding vegetation.\n\nDozing, stick raking and blade ploughing – are most suitable for moderate to heavy African Boxthorn infestations where the risk of damaging non-target vegetation on production lands is not a concern.\n\nCultivation – In areas that are to be used for pasture or crops, after physically removing the African Boxthorn, cultivation can be a useful technique. It will break up roots remaining in the soil and bring root fragments to the surface, where they will dry out and/or should be raked and burned. Follow-up vigorous native perennial pastures compete with African Boxthorn. Establish pastures as soon as possible after weed removal. Consult an agronomist for advice on pasture establishment and management for your location.\n\nMachine-based cut stump – Another option is machine-based cut-stump control, which involves cutting the plant near its base then immediately applying herbicide.\n\nDisposal:  With each of the above techniques, African Boxthorn bushes should be piled and burnt.\n\nFollow-up: Return to the site and treat regrowth from the roots or plant base with herbicide, and hand pull, cut and paint, or spray seedlings. Follow-up will be required until there is no more regrowth or seed germination.\n\nBiological control: CSIRO has undertaken research that focuses on identifying which of the many natural enemies that attack African boxthorn in the native range of South Africa are the most appropriate candidate biological control agents for this weed (CSIRO 2015-2020). This research on African boxthorn has been part of the projects ‘Biocontrol solutions for sustainable management of weed impacts to agricultural profitability’ (2016-2020) and ‘Underpinning agricultural productivity and biosecurity by weed biological control‘ (2019-2022), led by AgriFutures Australia (the trading name of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC)). These projects have been supported by funding from the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry as part of its Rural R&D for Profit programme rounds 2 and 4, respectively. Biosecurity South Australia (Primary Industries and Regions South Australia), the Shire of Ravensthorpe, Western Australia, and the New South Wales Government through its Environmental Trust are also acknowledged for their financial support (CSIRO 2015-2020).\n\nMore information can be found here https://research.csiro.au/african-boxthorn/",

    "similarSpecies": "A native species, Lycium australe, is found in subsaline soils in semiarid areas of Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. The most obvious differences are that it has smaller berries (2-5 mm diameter) than African Boxthorn and the stamens are of a similar length to the flower whereas those of African Boxthorn protrude beyond the petals (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nThere are two other introduced species of Lycium naturalised in Australia.\n\nLycium barbarum is presently of interest because it is the Goji berry of the health food market. It is found in south-eastern Australia. Unlike African Boxthorn its branches are weak and arching.\n\nLycium afrum is recorded from Victoria and Tasmania and has deep maroon flowers and purplish or black berries (Barker 2007, pers. comm.; CRC 2007).\n\nAfrican boxthorn can also look superficially similar to the native shrub Nitraria billardierei  that African Boxthorn is replacing in some sandy and coastal, semi-arid and arid areas across central, western and some southern areas of Australia.",

    "habitat": "Ludwigia grows in humid warm-temperate to tropical regions. It occurs in stationary or moving fresh water to 1 m deep in lagoons, swamps, or on the margins of creeks and rivers (Sainty & Jacobs 1981; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In deeper waters, the plant survives by producing pneumatophores (erect roots that protrude above the surface) that enable air to be carried to the submerged tissues (Jacobs et. al. 1994). In shallow permanent water, the plant encroaches on open water by gradually forming a mat of fallen stems and trapped debris. From the fallen stems, new stems grow upright to form dense shrubs (Jacobs et. al. 1994).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Ludwigia reduces the rate of flow in streams and causes wide ecological damage by increasing sedimentation. The accumulation of additional organic material results in the deoxygenation of the water column which leads to the death of aquatic fauna and a change in flora species composition. Dense stands of Ludwigia can intercept almost all light, dominate all other water plants and in some cases lead to the loss of native plants and animals. In areas where it has been established longest, such as the Botany Wetlands, monospecific stands have formed, native water plants have been crowded out, and bird populations have diminished (Jacobs et al. 1994).\n\nLudwigia has the potential to interfere with animal access for drinking water, human access for swimming and boating, reduce water quality and block pumps (Campbelltown City Council undated).",
    "controlMethods": "Management of Ludwigia needs to focus on the control of the seedlings and the soil seed bank as it is important to control the major source of dispersal before the rate of spread becomes too great. Flowering and fruiting do not usually occur in the first year, so the plants can be controlled at any time in the first 18 months without the risk of seed set. Germination can be suppressed by high degrees of shading. The soil seed bank may be greatly reduced after two or three years without input. The plant appears to be susceptible to drying out and new shoots appear to be susceptible to flooding (Jacobs et. al. 1994).\n\nApply herbicides when the plant is actively growing at or beyond the early bloom stage of growth but before theautumn change of colour. Thorough coverage is necessary for best results. Spraying results can be improved by slashing stands prior to flowering, then spraying the regrowth 2–4 weeks later. Repeat applications may be required for larger plants, and a follow up program will be required to deal with seedlings. Care should be taken not to inadvertently spread seed attached to clothing (NSW Agriculture undated).\n\nNo known research has been conducted on introduced biological control agents and the species is not currently a Target for Biological Control. There is some evidence of ecological control by shading under dense planting. Because Ludwigia seedlings require high light levels for germination, it can be appropriate in some locations to establish dense, shady cover following clearing. In the long term, reducing nutrient levels entering water bodies can also lower the risk of invasion or spread (NSW Agriculture Undated).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "controlMethods": "Management of Long-leaved Water Primrose should focus on control of the seedlings and soil seed bank as it is important to control the major source of dispersal before the rate of spread becomes too great. Control of plants with herbicide or by physical means is effective but constrained by the nature of the wetland habitats and the prolific seedling growth (Port Stephens Council 2006). To manually remove the infestation, first carefully remove any seed heads and bag them securely in plastic bags. Mature fruits are easily spread causing long term land contamination and care should be taken not to inadvertently spread seed attached to clothing. Seedlings can be hand pulled, but larger plants will re-shoot unless the majority of the long root system is removed. Plant segments can resprout so incinerate or seal in plastic bags all plant parts to avoid further spread. Always follow up by rechecking the plant for any regrowth and the area for any new seedlings (Sydney Weeds Committee 2006).\n\nTo use chemical control scrape or cut and paint stems of mature plants with a herbicide. Treat or remove plants in spring and summer while actively growing before seed maturity and preferably before seed set (Great Lakes Local Council 2006).\n\nThere are no official biological control agents for Long-leaved Water Primrose in Australia, and the species is not currently a Target for Biological Control. However a native Flea Beetle (Altica sp.: Chrysomelidae) has been observed feeding on plants and potentially could be used to control infestations. Research into aspects of utilising Altica beetles for control is underway at several sites in Port Stephens (Port Stephens Council 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "impact": "Japanese Honeysuckle is a weed of native environments and toxic to humans causing discomfort and irritation but is not life threatening.It forms dense, long-lived masses and tolerates moderate-shade, frost, salt, damage, wet or dry, most soils, high to low temperature. Very long stems layer profusely, with moderate-fast growth rate.\n\nAgriculture: Not a known weed of agriculture, can be present in vegetation around margins of paddocks.\n\nNative ecosystems: Japanese Honeysuckle is a highly invasive environmental weed that is capable of smothering and out competing native vegetation by climbing over shrubs, up tree branches and across ground flora to form extensive suckering mats which also prevent further regeneration of native species. This process results in a significant reduction in the diversity of native flora (Muyt 2001; GISD 2005) and associated fauna. It is a very serious threat to native vegetation in heathland and heathy woodland, damp sclerophyll forest, wet sclerophyll forest, warm temperate rainforest and along streams (Carr et al. 1992). In NSW and Queensland it is also weedy and naturalised in or near rainforests and other closed forests, particularly those close to habitation. It also grows in riparian areas, distrubed sites and waste areas in wetter temperate, sub-tropical and tropical regions (Brisbane City Council 2021).\n\nUrban environments: Can escape gardens and establish in semi-urban environments and roadside vegetation.\n\nHuman impacts: Japanese honeysuckle is toxic to humans, causing discomfort and irritation but is not life threatening. The berries and leaves are poisonous if ingested, causing gastro-intestinal irritation. It is also a skin irritant causing rashes on contact with the plant.\n\nWhat to do if poisoning occurs:\n\nIf the patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nIf the patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",
    "controlMethods": "Infestations of Japanese Honeysuckle require an integrated program utilising various control methods. The most effective eradication technique seems to be a combination of herbicide application and burning (GISD 2005).\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual removal can be used for seedlings and small infestations but is not recommended for large infestations where it is likely to be ineffective and lead to considerable soil disturbance and further spread (Muyt 2001). Mowing and grazing control its spread but do not eradicate it.\n\nFire: Prescribed burns remove above-ground vegetation and reduce new growth but do not destroy roots, which continue to produce sprouts.\n\nChemical control: A range of herbicide treatments can be used including painting root crowns after stems have been cut back, using Drill-Fill and Stem-Scrape methods to treat larger climbing stems and spraying with selective and non-selective herbicides. Follow-up treatments are often required because plants commonly re-shoot (Muyt 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "similarSpecies": "Japanese Honeysuckle is unlikely to be confused with any Australian native or other naturalised species when in flower. Non-flowering plants may appear similar to other climbers with leaves in opposite pairs such as some native members of the Asclepiadaceae and Apocynaceae families including Milk Vine (Marsdenia rostrata), Yellow Milk Vine (Marsdenia flavescens), Bearded Tylophora (Tylophora barbata) and Silkpods (Parsonsia species) (Reid 2007, pers. obs.). It can also be confused with the other introduced honeysuckles;  winter honeysuckle (Lonicera fragrantissima); and European honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum).\n\nWinter honeysuckle (Lonicera fragrantissima) is an upright shrubby plant with hairless (i.e. glabrous) younger stems. Its flowers are borne in pairs in the leaf forks and its mature fruit are red in colour.\n\nEuropean honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) is a climber or scrambling shrubby plant with hairy (i.e. pubescent) reddish-coloured younger stems. Its flowers are borne in dense clusters at the tips of the branches and its mature fruit are red in colour.",

    "habitat": "Yellow Burrhead usually grows partly immersed in water, preferring shallow, stagnant or slow-flowing water. It grows in tropical to subtropical conditions, in freshwater pools, swamps, wetlands, ditches and at the edges of deeper waterbodies such as streams and dams. It thrives in nutrient-enriched water (NSW DPI 2020).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Yellow Burrhead is an aquatic plant that could become a major weed of wetlands, slow-moving streams and dams in tropical and semi-tropical areas (CRC 2003; NSW DPI 2020). It is a threat to the environmental integrity of wetlands, as this weed competes with native plants for space, light and nutrients. The altered ecological balance may then seriously impact on native aquatic fauna (The State of Queensland 2021). Clumps of the weed provide suitable breeding sites for disease-carrying mosquitoes (GISD 2005).\n\nAgriculture: Yellow Burrhead is a serious agricultural and economic weed overseas. In south and south-east Asia, it is a major weed of rice paddy fields (Kotalawala 1976; Sainty & Associates 2002; Karthigeyan et al. 2004; The State of Queensland 2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Yellow Burrhead also chokes and reduces the effectiveness of irrigation and drainage channels, blocking or slowing water flow and trapping silt and other sediments. This can interfere with flood mitigation (Sainty & Associates 2002; The State of Queensland 2021; NSW DPI 2020).",
    "controlMethods": "Yellow Burrhead is one of the species targeted for national eradication under the National Resource Management Ministerial Council's National Cost-Sharing Eradication Programmes. These programmes map and monitor the full distribution of the species, and coordinate or undertake activities to eradicate that species from Australia. Eradication programs for Yellow Burrhead have been undertaken in Centenary Lakes, Cairns, and the Townsville district (Sainty & Associates 2002).\n\nChemical control: Varieties of Yellow Burrhead have demonstrated herbicide resistance in Malaysia and Indonesia (Heap 2005). See the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: With unusual foliage and attractive flowers, Yellow Burrhead is likely to be lurking unrecognised in suburban backyards, especially those featuring 'Asian water gardens'. Early detection and measures to prevent the spread of this weed are the best ways to control it. Report any findings to your local authority or weed management agency. Specimens will need to be positively identified at your state or territory herbarium, and specialist assistance should be sought to minimise the risk of accidental dispersal of the tiny seeds. All occurrences must be reported and fully documented before removal, to facilitate follow-up as part of the national eradication campaign. Infested sites need ongoing inspection to prevent re-infestation from the seed bank (CRC 2003).\n\nPrevention: Yellow Burrhead is banned from being imported into Australia, and should not be sold by plant nurseries or cultivated in ponds and water gardens (The State of Queensland 2021; NSW DPI 2020).\n\nFor further management and control information see CRC (2003), Waterhouse (2003), GISD (2005), The State of Queensland (2021) and NSW DPI (2020).",

    "similarSpecies": "There are several native and introduced species that are large, emergent, broad-leafed plants (usually perennials) with large, longitudinally veined leaf blades on bare stalks like Yellow Burrhead. Most of these can be distinguished from Yellow Burrhead when in flower by their bigger flower heads with numerous smallish white or pale pink flowers – this includes species of Alisma, Damasonium minus, species of Caldesia, and Sagittaria platyphylla (all in family Alismataceae).\n\nButomopsis latifolia, a Northern Territory native in family Limnocharitaceae (possibly also occurring in Queensland, and widespread in the tropics from South-east Asia to Africa), has more slender leaf and flower stalks, generally narrower leaf blades (1–7 cm wide) with up to 7 main longitudinal veins, and clusters of 7-25 or more white flowers (Cowie et al. 2000; Holmes et al. 2005).\n\nWater Poppy (Hydrocleys nymphoides), naturalised in Queensland and Victoria, is in the same family as Yellow Burrhead but its leaves are floating to emergent and smaller (up to 12 cm across) while its 3-petalled yellow flowers are single (not in clusters) and bigger (up to 8 cm across) (Stephens & Dowling 2002; Sainty & Jacobs 2003).\n\nVegetatively, Yellow Burrhead can look rather like a Giant Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), but that is usually a free-floating plant and has striking blue-violet flowers in a spike-like flower head (Sainty & Jacobs 2003; Wilson & Kodela 2007, pers. comm.).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Chinese Privet was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Chinese Privet was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nNative ecosystems: Chinese Privet is a significant environmental weed in New South Wales and Queensland, and an emerging or potential environmental weed in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. It is of most concern in south-eastern Queensland, where it is ranked among the top 25 environmental weeds, and in eastern New South Wales (Batianoff & Butler 2002; Navie & Adkins 2007). Chinese Privet invades gullies, creeklines, watercourses, forest gaps and the margins of rainforests and forms dense thickets that shade out other plants. It out-competes or suppresses native vegetation and can dominate the shrub layer of an invaded habitat, altering the composition and structure of the community. This transforms the habitat available to native animals and stands of this weed may also hinder animal movement through bushland areas (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nHuman impacts: The leaves and fruit of Chinese Privet are poisonous to livestock and humans. It also produces masses of heavily scented white flowers that cause severe allergic reactions in susceptible people (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nAgriculture: An unidentified toxin in the leaves and fruit of narrow leaf privet may cause tremors and seizures in poultry. No cases have occurred in Australia (NSW WeedWise 2020).",
    "controlMethods": "Controlling the spread of Chinese Privet requires the removal of larger seed-producing trees, in order to prevent further dispersal by birds (Mowatt 1998). Check with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for Chinese Privet control.\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical control: Large pure stands of Chinese Privet can be cleared using bulldozers or manually. Cleared areas should then be revegetated with native trees, shrubs and ground cover plants and repeatedly hand-weeded or otherwise maintained until the natural vegetation becomes established.\n\nManual control: Removing isolated Chinese Privet plants from natural bush should be done with minimal disturbance to the native vegetation, as Chinese Privet and other weeds are often better able to take advantage of disturbance. Younger plants can be hand-pulled, and uprooted plants should be placed upside-down with their roots in the air, to dry out.\n\nFire: Chinese Privet thickets do not usually carry fires and the plants regenerate rapidly by sprouting or suckering after fire. As a result, burning is usually not feasible or is ineffective (Mowatt 1998).\n\nLand management: Reducing or stopping the movement of nutrients in water  into riparian areas may help prevent establishment of large privet infestations (NSW WeedWise 2020).\n\nChemical control: Older plants can be controlled using herbicides, applied according to the cut stump, basal bark or stem injection methods (Land Protection 2006). Other herbicide application methods that can be used on Chinese Privet include spraying and, splatter gun (NSW WeedWise 2020).\n\nSee the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Chinese Privet can generally be distinguished from these other species by its hairy younger stems and leaves. Broad-leaved Privet also has larger leaves (4 to 24 cm long) and has a larger stature, sometimes reaching up to 12 m tall, while Common Privet loses its leaves during winter. Native Privet, which is only present in northern and central Queensland, has smaller flowers with petals only about 2 mm long (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nChinese Privet can also be confused with various native rainforest species (e.g. Syzygium spp.) when not in flower or fruit.",

    "habitat": "Broad-leaf Privet is mainly a weed of wetter sub-tropical and warmer temperate regions, but it may occasionally be found in tropical and cooler temperate environments. It has become naturalised in and around rainforest areas, along roadsides and waterways, and in open woodlands, pastures, grasslands, waste areas and disturbed sites (Navie & Adkins 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Broad-leaf Privet was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Broad-leaf Privet was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national signficance.\n\nNative ecosystems: Broad-leaf Privet causes widespread and significant environmental damage in eastern Australia. It is regarded as an environmental weed or potential environmental weed in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory, and is currently of most concern in south-eastern Queensland and eastern New South Wales. Broad-leaf Privet has become an invasive weed of rainforests, gullies and waterways and can invade relatively intact rainforest communities. It can form dense thickets, particularly in coastal areas, which shade out and displace native species. This can transform the habitat available to native animals, creating an ecosystem dominated by weeds, and disrupting the access of animals to natural corridors (Land Protection 2006; Navie & Adkins 2007). Broad-leaf Privet also supports artificially high numbers of pied currawongs (Strepera graculina) in New South Wales, disrupting the natural ecological balance and adversely affecting other native birds (Blood 2001).\n\nIn New South Wales Broad-leaf Privet is present in coastal districts north from Bega, on the far south coast, and inland to West Wyalong. It is widely distributed throughout south-eastern Queensland and can also be found on the Atherton Tablelands, in northern Queensland. Small naturalised populations also exist in north-eastern and southern Victoria, where it is regarded as a potential threat to grasslands, woodlands, riparian vegetation and eucalypt forests (Navie &Adkins 2007).\n\nHuman impacts: The leaves and fruit of this species are poisonous to livestock and humans (Navie & Adkins 2007). Broad-leaf Privet pollen is also known to cause significant irritation to hay fever sufferers (Mowatt 1998).",
    "controlMethods": "Controlling the spread of Broad-leaf Privet requires the removal of larger seed-producing trees, in order to prevent further dispersal by birds (Mowatt 1998).\n\nCheck with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for Broad-leaf Privet control.\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical and manual control: Large pure stands of Broad-leaf Privet can be cleared using bulldozers or manually. Cleared areas should then be revegetated with native trees, shrubs and ground cover plants and repeatedly hand-weeded or otherwise maintained until the natural vegetation becomes established. Removing isolated Broad-leaf Privet plants from natural bush should be done with minimal disturbance to the native vegetation, as Broad-leaf Privet and other weeds are often better able to take advantage of disturbance. Younger plants can be hand-pulled, and uprooted plants should be placed upside-down with their roots in the air, to dry out.\n\nFire: Broad-leaf Privet thickets do not usually carry fires and the plants regenerate rapidly by sprouting or suckering after fire, so burning is usually not feasible or ineffective (Mowatt 1998).\n\nChemical control: Older plants can be controlled using herbicides, applied according to the cut stump, basal bark or stem injection methods (Land Protection 2006).\n\nAlso see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.",

Chinese Privet can also be distinguished by its hairy younger stems and common privet by the fact that it loses its leaves during winter. Native Privet, which is only present in northern and central Queensland, also has smaller flowers with petals only about 2 mm long (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nBroad-leaf Privet can also be confused with various native rainforest species when not in flower or fruit, including cheese tree (Glochidion ferdinandi) and many of the Lilly-pilly's (Syzygium spp.) (Blood 2001).",

(DPI NSW 2019; Jeanes 1999; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Ox-eye Daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare) spreads quickly and forms dense stands in agricultural areas and in native vegetation. It grows so densely that most other vegetation is excluded, and consequently it may seriously devalue pasture and threaten the integrity of native vegetation.  can increase the risk of soil erosion when the above ground plant parts die off over summer, leaving large areas of bare ground (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nAgriculture: Can invade pastures and replace desirable pasture species reducing carrying capacity. Although not poisonous to stock,  is unpalatable to livestock, and imparts a disagreeable taste to milk if eaten by cattle. Plants produce copious seed (1 300-26 000 per plant) which may remain dormant in the soil for as long as 20 years or more. In the United States of America, Ox-eye Daisy hosts viruses that may affect crop species, but it is not known if, or to what extent, this might occur in Australia (Howarth & Williams 1968; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Ox-eye Daisy invades lowland grassland and grassy woodlands, damp sclerophyll forests, riparian vegetation, alpine and sub-alpine vegetation (Carr et al. 1992) and out-competes native plants including some endangered species DPI NSW (2019). Dense infestations  are capable of displacing native plants and it is not readily grazed by native animals, no doubt reducing resources (food sources) available for native fauna.\n\nUrban areas: Invades roadside vegetation and nature parks.",
    "controlMethods": "Ox-eye Daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare) can be hard to manage because it spreads so easily. Plants can be manages and controlled using herbicides and by physical and mechanical removal, cultivation and pasture management.  Using an integrated approach ( the use of different control options) will yield the best overall result. As plants produces many (each plant can produce up to 26,000 seeds) long-lived seeds, follow up will be critical. Return to control areas regularly to check progress and re-treat when needed.\n\nChemical control: A variety of chemical controls can be used in areas not suited to cultivation, but herbicides may damage non-target species (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).  Spraying large infestations is most effective when plants are in the early flowering stage. High rates of herbicide are needed to manage ox-eye daisy therefore early action to prevent large infestations establishing is best DPI NSW (2019). See DiTomaso &. Kyser et al. (2013). DPI NSW (2019) for some herbicide treatment that proved effective. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  Small population and outliers can be hand pulled or removed with hand tools. Remove roots from at least 10 cm below ground to avoid regrowth of the plant. This is easiest when the soil is damp and loose. Follow-up treatment will be required if seeds have been shed.\n\nMechanical control:  Because of its shallow root system, Ox-eye Daisy is easily killed by intensive cultivation. Deep cultivation (to 20 cm) can be effective, especially in summer. Additionally, shallower cultivation can kill seedlings and plants that have regrown from root fragments. Shallow cultivation on its own can spread the plant via root fragments. In pasture, mowing as soon as the first flowers open can prevent seed production. However, mowing may also stimulate shoot production and subsequent flowering in areas with adequate growing seasons (DPI NSW 2019).\nCompetition and management: Because seeds germinate readily on bare soil, keeping bare soil to a minimum is valuable in reducing seedling recruitment (Olson & Wallander 1999). Cultivation can be used as part of an integrated control program and followed up with the establishment of competitive plants like perennial pasture species. Repeat efforts and follow-up  will be needed to manage any seed stored in the soil.\nBiological control: one options for bio-control has been investigated by CSIRO, the rhizome-feeding moth Dichrorampha aearata  and an application to release it in Australia is currently being prepared. A second promising candidate bio-control agent for ox-eye daisy is under investigation, the root-feeding weevil Cyphocleonus trisulcatus. See CSIRO (2020) for details.",

Hoary Cress favours disturbed sites such as roadsides, waste places, drainage lines and irrigation ditches (Scurfield 1962; Lyons 1998).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Hoary Cress (Lepidium draba) is a significant weed of crops, reducing yields through competition. It is widespread on arable land, waste ground and roadsides drainage lines and irrigation ditches and can spreads to nearby areas or further by water.\n\nAgriculture: In Australia, it is a weed of grain crops, pastures and horticultural crops such as vegetables, orchards and vineyards, and causes serious yield reductions and may interfere with harvesting in cereal and other crops It is a weed of both cultivation and minimum tillage systems. In established lucerne it can be competitive if present in large numbers. It is seldom grazed but milk and meat may become tainted if plants are consumed for about a week after ingestion. It has poisonous properties and is suspected of causing stock losses but rarely eaten in sufficient quantity to cause problems. Established infestations are very difficult to eradicate, mainly because of the vigorous perennial root system. The roots of Hoary Cress contain chemicals that hinder the germination and growth of companion plants, especially cereals. Infestations can completely dominate fields and, when in flower, form massive drifts of white (Faithfull 1998; Agriculture Western Australia 2005; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; DPIW 2002). A highly competitive weed and may carry viruses and diseases of Brassica crops. As it is part of the Brassica family, it poses a major problem when canola or similar cops in the family are grown is part of the cropping rotation, as it cannot be controlled in-crop (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nNative ecosystems: Not normally a weed of native areas, but found in disturbed riparian areas.\n\nUrban areas: A weed of roadsides, creeks and drains and potentially parks and gardens.",
    "controlMethods": "Hoary Cress (Lepidium draba) can spread by both seed and more commonly via root fragments although most new plants arise from its spreading roots and broken root segments. Integrated control of Hoary Cress  includes prevention, education, early detection and eradication. Prevention is essential in preventing further outbreaks and spread.  Most successful control efforts combine several management techniques such as herbicide application and physical removal by cultivation, followed by competitive species plantings (Lyons 1998). Its impact was largely curtailed through the incorporation of longer pasture phases in cereal cropping rotations and through the use of more effective herbicides (Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can be used successfully in controlling Hoary Cress. Timing of herbicide applications is critical in achieving desirable results and several years of treatments may be required (DPIW 2002). Numerous treatments area available, see CABI 2021; DPI NSW (2019) Herbiguide (2021).\n\nAlways consult label information and Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Not normally effective as roots with buds left in the soil will re-sprout and regrow.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation alone is neither practical nor sufficient to provide long-term control of Hoary Cress. The most effective control needs to be intensive cultivation carried out on a monthly or fortnightly basis over several years (Mulligan & Findley 1974; Faithfull 1998). Avoid using single cultivation and clean all machinery as as broken root pieces can increase infestations or spread the weed to new locations. Can be controlled via removal by cultivation, but follow-up is normally required.\nCompetition and management: Ensuring thorough cleaning of cultivation, harvesting and road maintenance equipment that has been working in infested areas will help prevent its spread. Hay and crop seeds may also contain seed of Hoary Cress if they have been sourced from infested paddocks. Hoary Cress will persist after, and tolerate heavy grazing; thus it may be used successfully in permanent pasture. Grazing should be timed to prevent seed production in this species and movement of stock that have grazed mature plants and may subsequently transport seed to uninfested areas should be restricted (Agriculture Western Australia 2005; DPIW 2002).",

    "similarSpecies": "Several other species of Lepidium (native and exotic) occur in Australia and may be mistaken for Hoary Cress. The fruit of Hoary Cress is more or less rounded or inflated, while those of other Lepidium species are generally strongly flattened. In addition, the fruits of Hoary Cress do not open at maturity, while the fruits of other Lepidium species open at maturity to release the seeds. Several other white-flowered members of the Brassicaceae family may also be confused with Hoary Cress, such as:\n\nShepherd's Purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris). It is an annual species that is almost hairless, its fruits are triangular or almost heart-shaped (cordate) in outline.\n\nPenny Cress (Thlaspi arvense) is an uncommon annual weed which is hairless. Its fruits are relatively large (10-20 mm long) and are rounded in outline (Navie 2004).",

It can also become a weed of cultivated crops, for example, it is often a serious weed of rice and sugarcane in South America (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Lion's Tail is capable of forming large colonies and dense thickets that can out-compete native vegetation, displace native plants and reduce biodiversity, e.g., along riverbanks and floodplains. Dense thickets become difficult to penetrate largely due to the spiky flower heads and are a nuisance because they hinder stock movement.\n\nAgriculture: In the Northern Territory Lion's Tail appears to be moving into similar habitats to those favoured by Hyptis, taking over disturbed sites. Because of its prolific seeding habits, it colonises disturbed areas around stock yards, overgrazed areas and along roads, as well as on river levees (Miller & Schultz 1999; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Lion's Tail is a serious weed of rice and sugarcane in South America and could become a problem in sugarcane in Queensland (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty & Associates 2007).\n\nHuman impacts: The sharp spiky seed heads are uncomfortable for people to touch and dense patches will reduce accessibility to areas (Miller & Schultz 1999; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Smith 2002; PIER 2003; Sainty & Associates 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Manual control: Small populations of Lion's Tail can be removed manually, preferably before seeding, and burnt. This needs to be followed by regular checks of the treated area to remove any seedlings. Large colonies can be controlled by cultivation where practicable, but all the plants must be completely buried and it should be followed by the establishment of a crop or pasture.\n\nChemical control: Plants in the vegetative stage before flowering can be sprayed with herbicide, but this will need to be repeated when any new seedlings appear (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

For example, it is one of a number of invasive weeds threatening the survival of the rare White Beauty Spider Orchid in the Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia (CRC for Australian Weed Management 2004; Watts & Vidler 2006; Bowcher 2007). A weed of open grassy woodlands, and grasslands in Mediterranean type climates.\n\nAgriculture: It can also have impacts on agriculture. It is not eaten by domestic stock and out-competes desirable pasture species, reducing the carrying capacity of the land and causing the loss of production. Heavy grazing around infestations encourages its spread and dense stands may also harbour rabbits (Thorp & Wilson 1998 – ; Muyt 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; CRC for Australian Weed management). Topped Lavender establishes well on bare soil and in disturbed sites, persisting and becoming dominant once established, to the detriment of other vegetation (Weber 2003).\n\nUrban areas: Also invades roadsides, wasteland, and persists in abandoned gardens and little cared for areas, spreading by seed.",
    "controlMethods": "Topped Lavender can be controlled by physical means, and with herbicides. Grazing is not effective and heavy grazing may make the infestation worse.\n\nNon-chemical control: Individual plants can be hand-pulled, dug out or grubbed and the main roots removed in native, urban or agricultural areas. Large infested areas on agricultural land are best ploughed in spring and cultivated whenever seedlings and regrowth emerge. Either autumn sowing with a suitable pasture mixture or improving pastures will provide competition for further seedlings. Slashing and mowing of mature plants alone will not be effective because the plant regrows readily from the woody base, although this method may be effective when used with herbicide application.\n\nFire: Dense populations can be burnt (following proper controlled burn procedures and regulations) in autumn to open up infestations for follow-up control with herbicides or mechanical control.\n\nChemical control: May also be used, such as spraying regrowth in spring. Since seedlings colonise best over bare ground it is a good strategy to establish a vigorous groundcover with more desirable species to minimise re-invasion. Because the seed of Topped Lavender is long-lived in the soil, monitoring and control practices must be continued for several years (Blaylock & Moerkerk 2000; Muyt 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Weber 2003; Bowcher 2007).\n\nSee the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "Topped Lavender is native to the Mediterranean region, and has been widely cultivated throughout the world as an ornamental plant (Upson & Andrews 2004; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) and for oil production.",
    "growthForm": "Shrub",
    "similarSpecies": "Less commonly naturalised species of Lavender (also garden escapes) in Australia include:\n\nFrench or Toothed Lavender (Lavandula dentata), which is distinguished from Topped Lavender by its finely scalloped or toothed leaves (the leaf margins are smooth and entire in Topped Lavender)\n\nEnglish Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and Spike Lavender (Lavandula latifolia), which are less readily distinguished from Topped Lavender (Hussey et al. 1997; Richardson et al. 2006; Upson & Andrews 2004), so expert identification should be sought from a state or territory herbarium.\n\nThe distinct lavender aroma, especially from crushing the leaves, distinguishes these introduced Lavender species from any similar looking native plants (Muyt 2001).",

Following an assessment process, Creeping Lantana was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national signficance.\n\nNative ecosystems: Little information is available on its environmental impact but it is known to readily displace native vegetation (CRC 2003). During successive dry seasons, Creeping Lantana can become an aggressive weed, due to its drought tolerance and scrambling growth form, replacing native grasses which may in turn affect grazing on native pastures (Everist 1981; Schultz 1994). It is believed to have the potential to impact on ecosystems in the same way as Lantana camara (North Coast Weed Read 2004) forming dense thickets that take over native bushland and impacting on biodiversity in affected areas.\n\nAgriculture: Creeping Lantana is toxic and suspected of poisoning cattle (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; CRC 2003). Creeping Lantana contains an unidentified nerve-damaging toxin, it is transferred through milk and calves from 6 weeks of age are affected if their mothers eat the plant (NSW WeedWise 2019).",
    "controlMethods": "An integrated approach similar to the control methods used in Lantana camara is expected to also be effective for the control of Lantana montevidensis (CRC 2003).\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual control: Where practicable, physical removal by grubbing or cultivating is an effective and low cost method of eradication.\n\nChemical control: In areas where this is not possible, herbicides may be a useful means of eradication. Spraying the entire plant (foliar spraying) usually kills plants that are less than 2 m high. Foliar applied sprays, are most effective when plants are actively growing. With Lantana, best results are obtained six weeks after good rains (at least 35 mm) when minimum temperatures exceed 15 ºC (CRC 2003).\n\nAlso see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nBiological control: Creeping Lantana has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process.

    "habitat": "Lantana can grow in high-rainfall areas with tropical, subtropical and warm temperate climates. It does not tolerate salty or dry soils, water-logging or low temperatures (<5 ºC). It thrives on rich, organic soils but also grows on well-drained clay and basalt soils. Sandy soils tend to dry out too rapidly for Lantana unless soil moisture is continually replenished. It has been reported at altitudes up to 1000 m in Queensland (CRC 2003).\n\nLantana invades disturbed sites, especially open sunny areas, such as roadsides, cultivated pastures and fencelines. Lantana invasion appears to be strongly correlated with disturbance. In primary production situations it predominately impacts on unimproved pastures or areas where soil is exposed and competition is reduced. In environmental systems lantana invades\nwhere there are significant breaks or gaps in forest canopies (Stock 2009). From there it can invade the edges of forests, but it does not fare as well under a heavy canopy as it is not very shade tolerant (CRC 2003). Lantana is now present at the headwaters of major west-flowing catchments of the Murray–Darling Basin, and it may be able to spread further west along riparian corridors given favourable climatic conditions (Stock 2009).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Lantana (Lantana camara) is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. Lantana forms dense, impenetrable thickets impacting agricultural, native ecosystems, urban areas and human health.\n\nAgriculture: Lantana forms dense, impenetrable thickets that take over pastures on the east coast of Australia. It competes for resources with, and reduces the productivity of, pastures and forestry plantations. It adds fuel to fires, and is toxic to stock (CRC 2003).  There does not appear to be any documentation of palatability and toxicity to native fauna. Toxicity seems likely to be related to genetic factors, not environmental ones. Most variants of Lantana (Lantana camara) in Australia are toxic to domestic livestock (sheep, cattle) to some degree (CRC 2003). DPI NSW (2019) state that all types and parts of lantana are considered poisonous to stock. Red-flowered lantana is most dangerous and stock poisoning is common. It happens most when new animals are introduced into Lantana areas and there is no other feed. Cattle used to grazing lantana-infested land are less likely to eat it. Early symptoms of lantana poisoning include, depression, loss of appetite, constipation, frequent urination, jaundice for 1 – 2 days,  inflamed eyes with a slight discharge, mouth area becoming inflamed, moist, and very sensitive, with a pink nose, bare skin becoming very sensitive to light, red and swollen, or may crack, turn black, and die. Stock usually die 1–4 weeks after symptoms appear. Death is slow and painful from liver and kidney failure. Some animals have heart damage.\n\nNative ecosystems: Lantana forms dense, impenetrable thickets that also easily take over native bushland, adding fuel to fires (CRC 2003). Lantana is a serious threat to biodiversity in several World Heritage-listed areas including the Wet Tropics of northern Queensland, Fraser Island and the Greater Blue Mountains. Numerous plant and animal species of conservation significance are threatened. It is listed as the most significant environmental weed by the South-East Queensland Environmental Weeds Management Group. Lantana dominance appears to adversely affect the species richness of soil fauna assemblages, such as ants, and decreases the diversity of soil fungi. It can also affect flora diversity by reducing seedling germination and by increasing the chance and severity of fire in plant communities such as dry rainforest. Lantana has been identified as a potential threat to many threatened and endangered plants and animals and a number of endangered ecological communities (DECC 2007).\n\nUrban areas: Can invade urban areas and All parts of the plant are poisonous to humans if eaten and can cause vomiting, diarrhoea, weak muscles, breathing problems, and sometimes death. Touching Lantana can irritate skin and eyes. Some toxic reactions have been recorded in humans, especially children (DECC 2007). If poisoning occurs and:\n\nthe patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nthe patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",
    "controlMethods": "An integrated approach that uses a variety of control methods gives best results when dealing with Lantana (Lantana camara). A range of methods including, herbicides, mechanical removal, fire, biological control and re-vegetation should be used. Best results are obtained by working from areas of light infestation towards heavier infestation, and long-term follow-up control is required after initial attempts. Minimise both disturbance to land and excessive use of fire to retain vigorous native vegetation and reduce the opportunity for Lantana to become established (CRC 2003). The combination of methods used will depend on the extent of the infestation, the land-form on which it is found, and the time of year during which control is to be undertaken. Re-vegetation of treated sites is also important. For more information on Lantana control see CRC 2003.\n\nChemical control: A variety of chemical controls are used to control Lantana and are described in detail in Stock (2009). The addition of penetrants and surfactants (adjuvants) to some herbicides may increase the herbicide absorption into the Lantana’s sap system.\n\nFoliar sprays: can be applied when the plants that are actively growing application to thoroughly wet all foliage and stems to the point of run-off. Use a nozzle configuration and pressure that ensures canopy penetration. Consideration for application of chemicals (normally listed on label) are; plant condition and size; environmental condition; application timing. Selective and residual herbicide can be used\n\nRoot application: is when a residual herbicide can be applied to the soil between the base of the plant and the drip-line, usually when the soil is wet or rain is expected , and is normally used where there are no native plants to be affected.\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface. This method is used for Lantana provide reliable control and can be useful where options are limited by the risk of off-target damage or the poor condition of the Lantana plants.\n\nCut, scrape and paint method: The cut, scrape and paint method is a variant of the cut stump method that requires more effort but is often more effective.\n\nBasal bark application: This technique involves the application of herbicide mixed with diesel directly to the lower trunk and over branches of the Lantana plant—similar to a form of chemical ring-barking.\n\nStock et al. (2009) and and DPI NSW (2019) provide detailed information on the use of herbicides to control Lantana. See References, links and further resources. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au. NOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control,  or manual methods such as hand pulling and grubbing and hand cutting may be suitable where infestations are hard to access with machinery and equipment and for the protection of certain threatened species, or where there is a desire to avoid the use of chemicals. as a follow-up treatment. It is most effective after rain when the soil is moist. A mattock, chip hoe or lever can be used to remove larger plants, including their root system.\n\nHand cutting with a powered brush-cutter can create access into heavy infestations for carrying out other control. Hand-held brush hooks or machetes can also be used.\n\nWarning: Touching Lantana can irritate skin and eyes and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) must be worn, examples, protective glasses or goggles covering eyes, and long sleeve tops and full length pants and boots with gloves protecting skin.\n\nMechanical control: Mechanical methods are usually most suitable for the control of extensive Lantana infestations. Methods used include; slashing involving cutting plants at the soil surface with blades or chains that spin parallel to the ground. Stick raking/pushing involves using a tractor-mounted rake or blade to push Lantana out of the ground. A stick rake attached to\na dozer removes the majority of the stump and root system from the ground while minimising the loss of topsoil. Mechanical grubbing removes entire Lantana plants from the ground with an implement attached to a tractor, backhoe, excavator or even a bobcat. It is suitable for scattered to moderate infestations of mature Lantana (Stock 2009).\n\nCompetition and management:  Competition from existing/sown grasses and scrambling legumes with subsequent trampling and grazing by livestock can reduce the size, height and density of a Lantana infestation, allowing access for follow-up controls. In native ecosystems re-vegetation is useful.\n\nFire: Control of Lantana using fire is  practiced as a cost-effective means of removing biomass and Lantana suppression. After a burn follow-up methods are critical in an integrated control program to treat any regeneration and germination of Lantana. Can be used in agricultural and natural ecosystems, see Stock (2009) for information.\n\nBiological control: Lantana has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.\n\nIn 1902 the first attempt at biological control of a weed targeted Lantana in Hawaii. In Australia biological control agents were first introduced in 1914; so far 31 species have been introduced. Research into biological control is ongoing, and several agents are currently being examined for suitability of release (CRC 2003). Of the 16 species that have established, four insects have had a major impact on Lantana: a sap-sucking bug (Teleonemia scrupulosa); two leaf-mining beetles (Uroplata girardi and Octotoma scabripennis); and a seed-feeding fly (Ophiomyia lantanae). The biological control agents vary in their effectiveness against the many different types of Lantana. For example, Lantana can drop its leaves when stressed, depriving some agents of their food (CRC 2003). Also these agents are seasonal and do not generally result in the death of the plants but should be used as part of an integrated control program.",

    "habitat": "Lagarosiphon grows best in clear, still or slow-moving freshwater with silty or sandy bottoms. This can be in ponds, lakes, dams and streams. It prefers the cooler waters of the temperate zone, with optimum temperatures of 20–23 °C and a maximum temperature of about 25 °C. It can live in high and low nutrient levels and grows best under conditions of high light intensity, but can tolerate shaded conditions. It also tolerates relatively high pH (i.e., alkaline conditions). Growth of Lagarosiphon is greatest in sheltered areas protected from wind, waves and currents (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; CRC 2003).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Lagarosiphon is an aquatic plant that can dominate freshwater lakes, dams and slow-moving streams. It grows extremely quickly from the bottom of a water body to the surface and forms dense mats several metres thick at or just below the water surface. These mats stop light from penetrating the water and displace native vegetation. Dense infestations can also deplete oxygen in the water (CRC 2003). Native fish, waterbirds and other fauna could be affected where the growth becomes dense and restrictive (Land Protection 2006).\n\nAs a submerged aquatic weed, Lagarosiphon is particularly difficult to control and spreads very readily. If it became naturalised in Australia, there is little doubt that it would cause similar detrimental impacts and be as hard to control as it is in New Zealand (CRC 2003).\n\nHuman impacts: Infestations of Lagarosiphon choke waterways and reduce the potential for recreational use (e.g. fishing, boating, swimming, diving) and commercial use (e.g. by blocking water intakes for hydro-electricity) (CRC 2003). The long stems could block inlets to water pumping equipment and affect propellers and cooling systems of recreation equipment (Land Protection 2006).\n\nAn impact assessment of Lagarosiphon is provided by Victorian Resources online at http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/impact_Lagarosiphon",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Preventing the establishment of Lagarosiphon is the best and most cost-effective method of control. It is illegal to grow Lagarosiphon in Australia. The aquarium and garden plant industries have a major role to play in abiding by the relevant legislation. The sale or dumping of Lagarosiphon should be reported to the authorities and people who have unknowingly cultivated it should contact local councils or state or territory weed management agencies for information on how to dispose of it properly. Burial is the quickest means of disposal. Drying in the sun and/or burning are also suitable, providing there is no risk of accidental spread into a waterway (CRC 2003). Coughlan et al. (2020) found that exposure of the plants to steam for about 30 s following removal from the water was extremely effective in killing the plants.\n\nEarly detection and eradication are also important to prevent infestations of Lagarosiphon. Small infestations can be easily eradicated if they are detected early but an ongoing commitment is needed to stop new infestations. Any outbreaks should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Do not try to control Lagarosiphon without their expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nNo importation of Lagarosiphon into Australia is permitted because of the risk of further spread, and the potential introduction of male plants and extra genetic diversity that could make future control more difficult (CRC 2003).\n\nThe New Zealand experience has shown the difficulty of eradicating Lagarosiphon. Only a few very small infestations have been eradicated and it has continued to spread into new areas. In most cases control is ongoing because, unless all the Lagarosiphon is collected, it can grow back from any remaining fragments. (CRC 2003). Manual removal of Lagarosiphon by hand or mechanically is not effective, as it is impossible to collect all the vegetation, enabling re-infestation from remaining fragments.\n\nLagarosiphon has also been mechanically harvested from accessible areas, using a variety of methods such as hand cutting and suction dredging. However, it is virtually impossible to mechanically collect all vegetation, even from small areas, and infestations are able to regenerate from remaining fragments (CRC 2003).\n\nOther methods that have been used include covering the plant with black sheeting and lowering water levels to dry out the weed. Biological control is not currently an option (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: At present the only herbicide that is considered to be environmentally acceptable in New Zealand does not kill the rhizomes, so regrowth is inevitable. This herbicide can be applied by helicopter, providing cost-effective control at recreational sites, albeit on an ongoing basis. An environmentally friendly systemic herbicide that targets the rhizomes is being sought (CRC 2003).\n\nSee the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) for chemical information at http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "There are about 16 species of Lagarosiphon from southern Africa and Madagascar, where they grow in high mountain streams and ponds. No species of Lagarosiphon are native to Australia (CRC 2003).",
    "growthForm": "Aquatic, Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "There are several water weeds similar to Lagarosiphon that are already present in Australia, especially in the south-east. These include Canadian Pondweed (Elodea canadensis), Hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata) and Egeria densa. They are all submerged aquatic plants that reproduce vegetatively and inhabit still or slow-moving fresh water. Lagarosiphon can be distinguished from these species because its leaves grow in alternate spirals along the length of the stem; the leaves of all the other species grow in whorls, or circles, around the stem (Ramey 2001; Sainty & Associates 2002; CRC 2003).",

Apart from causing a loss of plant biodiversity, which destroys habitat and resources for native animals, infestations of Yellow Soldier can reduce the recreational enjoyment of bushland by people (CRC 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Any new outbreaks of Yellow Soldier should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Do not try to control Yellow Soldier without their expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: In sandy soils Yellow Soldier bulbs can be removed by hand, particularly in late August to early September, by cutting the roots with a knife and pulling them out with the bulb. However, hand removal is difficult and time consuming and can cause major soil disturbance which may encourage other weeds. It is often impractical on a larger scale, especially given the high density at which these bulbous weeds often occur.\n\nFire is not recommended for control of Yellow Soldier, as it appears to be fire tolerant and regenerates soon after bushfire. Plants appear to flower particularly well following fire, setting prolific amounts of seed. In addition, fire reduces competition from native vegetation and creates bare areas where seed can germinate. However, fire can create opportunities for land managers to prevent further spread and establishment.\n\nChemical control: After fire, Yellow Soldier's flowers are clearly visible, and the reduced cover of native vegetation makes the resprouting flowering bulbs easy targets for herbicide control. Spot spraying reduces the cover of Yellow Soldier and appeared in one trial to have had insignificant effects on natives. The seed does not appear to remain viable in the soil for more than two or three years (CRC 2003).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",

    "habitat": "Spiny Rush usually grows in humid or sub-humid temperate regions, on disturbed areas at low altitude, such as roadsides, eroded gullies, pastures and over-grazed stream-banks, often in brackish or salt-affected areas (Wilson et al. 1993; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Hodgon 2006). Spiny rush prefers calcareous soils. It is principally dispersed via water, along drainage channels and creek lines and as such is found by fresh and saline areas such as coastal saltmarshes and inland depressions, frequently associated with ends of irrigation systems (Sainty & Jacobs 2003). Spiny Rush can colonise mine dumps and other areas of low fertility, and once established it does not require permanently wet soil in order to persist (Cunningham et al. 1992).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Spiny Rush is an agricultural and environmental pest able to tolerate both saline and fresh water and wet or dry conditions (Hodgon 2006), in open areas of wetlands, swamps and creeks with elevated salinity levels, including coastal flats. It also invades pastures and disturbed sites such as mine sites and dumps. It is capable of completely covering large areas in both agricultural, disturbed and in some undisturbed environments, preventing regeneration (Hodgon 2006). Once established, eliminates all other vegetation, makes areas impenetrable because of the sharp spines for larger animals and people.\n\nAgriculture: Spiny Rush reduces the productivity of pasture areas by competing with preferred pasture plants and soon dominates as it is not readily eaten by grazing animals. It can also spread to impede water flow in drains and channels (Sainty & Jacobs 1981; Auld & Medd 1992; Cunningham et al. 1992), with serious obstruction able to cause flooding (Anderson et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).  Dense thickets also prevent access to water by livestock (Anderson et al. 1998), and the sharp points at the ends of the stems and leaves are capable of causing serious injury (Hodgon 2006; & Cuthbertson 2001). Stands also provide an effective harbour for pest animals such as rabbits (Cunningham et al. 1992; Anderson et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Establishes in intact and disturbed natural ecosystems such as riparian vegetation and wetland areas.  Spiny Rush is not readily eaten by native grazing animals, and once established it can cover large areas eliminating and excluding other vegetation (Auld & Medd 1992; Cunningham et al. 1992; Anderson et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nHuman impacts: The sharp spines are a hazard to people, particularly to eyes, and are especially dangerous to children (Thorp & Wilson 1998 -).",
    "controlMethods": "Spiny Rush is very difficult to eradicate once it is established. It has the potential to be a troublesome weed in some places and should be controlled as early as possible. As with many weeds, controlling infestations early and preventing further spread will be the most effective form of management (Sainty & Jacobs 1981). Spiny Rush management programs using mechanical controls, chemicals, cultivation, altering salinity and drainage, and pasture management measures have been proposed (Anderson et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNon-chemical control: Even quite small plants can require a large amount of effort to remove (Sainty & Jacobs 2003); however, small stands of Spiny Rush may be dug out effectively, as the plant is shallow-rooted. The roots need to be severed and the top growth may also be burnt if seed is present.  Because the plant likes damp situations, improving drainage may help to reduce populations, but this would not be a suitable control measure where it is a weed in natural habitats such as wetlands (Ermert 2001). Machinery is used to cut spiny rush just below the ground surface. After physical removal,plants are heaped and burnt, and thenthe soil is cultivated to encourage the growth of seedlings. Follow-up cultivation over the following two summers are necessary to destroy seedlings, although some seed will remain to germinate in following years.Burning or slashing and then spraying or wiping new growth with herbicide can increase herbicide uptake, making the treatment more effective. (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nChemical control: Chemicals are not considered to be very successful in the reduction of Spiny Rush (Ermert 2001), but can be used to some effect in association with other control measures. Chemical control is often impractical because of the difficulty of application to dense patches; therefore, mechanical removal of the existing growth, although costly, is often the most practical starting point in a control program (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "The origin of Spiny Rush is obscure, but it is thought to have a wide native range including the Mediterranean region, western Europe, western North America, South America, Asia and southern Africa. (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Navie 2004).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "There are many species of rushes (Juncus spp.) and also some sedges (Cyperus spp. and Carex spp.) that are similar to Spiny Rush. Spiny Rush can usually be distinguished from these by its very sharply pointed stems and leaves (Navie 2004).\n\nSpiny Rush can be distinguished from the native species Juncus kraussii (which grows in brackish situations like saltmarshes) by its more robust, hemispherical tussocks (narrower, erect clumps in Juncus kraussii). Spiny rush has ripe fruits (seed capsules) that are only half covered by the tepals and are shiny, while Juncus kraussii  seed capsules are covered to emclosed by the tepals.\n\nIt differs from the most common erect native species like J. polyanthemus and J. usitatus in having long leaf blades – those native species have the leaf blade reduced to a tiny point on the leaf sheath (Wilson et al. 1993).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Bellyache Bush is a Weed of National Significance (WONS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nBellyache Bush has the capacity to form dense thickets which interfere with pasture growth, obscure fence lines, interfere with mustering and displace native vegetation (Pitt 1999). It is also poisonous to livestock and harbours feral animals (Csurhes 1999).\n\nThis toxic species is unpalatable to livestock, but accidental ingestion of Bellyache Bush seeds commonly occurs when animals browse on dry grass and fallen leaf litter during the dry season. In 1995, stock losses of 312 animals were attributed to Bellyache Bush in the Dalrymple shire in northern Queensland (Csurhes 1999).\n\nPure stands of Bellyache Bush also prevent the growth of pasture species and can render floodplain pastures totally unproductive. Bellyache Bush initially tends to invade disturbed areas and waterways. It eventually dominates these areas and then spreads slowly onto less disturbed land. At present, Bellyache Bush has a locally significant impact on grazing land along the banks of the Burdekin River and some of its tributaries. However, it has the potential to degrade grazing land over large areas of tropical grasslands and to threaten the future productivity of grazing enterprises in northern Australia. Declaration and preventative action by local and state government authorities has probably reduced the plant’s impact outside the heavily infested Burdekin catchment (Csurhes 1999).\n\nBellyache Bush is also regarded as an important environmental weed in the Northern Territory, Queensland and the northern parts of Western Australia (Smith 2002). It was recently listed as a priority environmental weed in five Natural Resource Management regions, and is ranked among the top 200 most invasive plant species in south-eastern Queensland (Batianoff & Butler 2002; Navie & Adkins 2007). Of particular concern is the impact that this species has on riparian habitats in semi-arid regions. In these areas it replaces native vegetation and may delay or prevent regeneration of native shrubs and trees (Smith 2002). Extensive Bellyache Bush thickets may also degrade wildlife habitat and reduce both plant and animal biodiversity at a local level (Csurhes 1999).\n\nBellyache Bush has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls",
    "controlMethods": "Physical control: As Bellyache Bush is shallow-rooted, small plants can be pulled out and larger plants can be grubbed out by hand (Land Protection 2006). Individual or scattered Bellyache Bush plants can also be treated with a cut stump application of diesel fuel or a registered herbicide. Larger infestations should be treated with suitable foliar or soil-applied herbicides (Pitt 1999). Fire can also be effective, with high kill rates being observed in the field when there is a sufficient fuel load to carry a fire through a Bellyache Bush infestation (Land Protection 2006).\n\nExtensive infestations should be fenced off to prevent grazing and to limit the movement of contaminated vehicles and livestock (Pitt 1999). The establishment of vigorous pastures in areas that have been treated or burnt will also help to prevent re-invasion.\n\nChemical control: Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nBiological control: Bellyache Bush has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. One agent released, the Jewel bug (Agonsoma trilineatum), with others prioritised for release and further research (Harvey et al 2023).\n\nChemical control: Check with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for the control of Bellyache Bush.",

    "habitat": "In its natural habitat in western North America, Poverty Weed prefers soils with poor drainage, seasonally wet areas, alkaline regions, and saline areas such as salt marshes, and an altitude from 10 to 2500 metres above sea level. It is also frequently a weed in cultivated fields. Although it prefers alkaline and saline soils, it is not confined to these soil types. In the United States of America, Poverty Weed is a natural component of many grassland communities that are subject to occasional fires, for which it is adapted (Bassett et al. 1962; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center 2006; Strother 2006; Department of Primary Industries 2007).\n\nIn Australia, Poverty Weed has been reported to invade neglected vineyards, orange groves, pasture, cropping land and roadsides, occurring in areas with an annual rainfall between 300 and 600 mm (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Poverty Weed (Iva axillaris) is a highly invasive weed that is mainly a weed of agriculture. It is a strong competitor and reduces crop yields (Richardson et al. 2007) and has also been reported as aggressively competing with native species (Richardson et al. 2007) The roots reach 2.5 metres deep consisting of both vertical and horizontal roots. Poverty Weed colonises cultivated land or overgrazed pastures. Aerial growth dies in autumn leaving the potential for surface soil erosion (Agriculture Victoria 2021).\n\nAgriculture: The extensive rhizome system produced by Poverty Weed allows it to strongly compete with crops, especially cereals, for water and nutrients. Rots extent for Both the above ground parts of the plant and the roots and rhizomes are known to reduce germination of other species, a potential threat to crop and pasture (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The plant is not thought to be toxic but, as it has a strong disagreeable scent, it is rarely grazed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: There is almost no information available about the impacts that the species has or potentially may have on Australian native ecosystems. Because Poverty Weed can form extensive clonal colonies, it has the potential to displace native grasses/forbs in open situations, particularly where there has been some disturbance. It has been assessed as posing a moderately high threat to Plains Grassy Woodland in the Wimmera bioregion. As the species prefers saline areas, it may also pose a threat to saline ecosystems, such as salt marsh communities (Department of Primary Industries 2000; Stajsic 2008 pers. comm.).\n\nUrban areas: In North America, Poverty Weed has been reported to cause contact dermatitis, and its pollen apparently exacerbates hay fever (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center 2006).",
    "controlMethods": "The extensive and deep network of rhizomes, as well as the colonising habit of the species make eradication and control difficult. The movement of agricultural seeds, grain, forage, fodder, soil and machinery contaminated with seeds, and particularly rhizome fragments, from infested areas to clean areas needs to be restricted (EPPO 2001). To help prevent weed spread, good farm hygiene practices should be followed, such as cleaning soil and crop debris from machinery, clothes and shoes before moving between fields and farms (Spora & Johnson 2002).\n\nChemical control: Because mechanical disturbance of infestations will only exacerbate the problem, herbicide application appears to offer the main effective means of control (Bassett et al. 1962; Williamson 1996; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Effective control may be achieved by using a combination of herbicides, sprayed in summer, during the active growth period of the species. Follow up management may need to be continued for several years to treat any resprouting from rhizomes (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  Hand pulling is difficult leaving viable root system with frequent hand-pulling required for regrowth. In addition plants  may cause allergic symptoms in people and gloves should be worn at all times.\n\nMechanical control:  Cultivation may spread root fragments and is not recommended. Mowing is not effective, as plants regrow.\nCompetition and management: Plant desirable vegetation to help prevent infestations and suppress growth of existing infestations.",
    "origin": "Poverty Weed is native to western North America, mainly west of the Continental Divide. It occurs from southern British Columbia to California and New Mexico, and eastward to South Dakota (Bassett et al. 1962; GRIN 2008).

    "habitat": "Knobweed occurs in the humid tropics and subtropics, in high rainfall areas, growing best in disturbed areas on heavy soils retaining moisture. It is a weed of roadsides, waste places, creek banks, ditches, headlands, cultivations and degraded pastures, especially in damp low-lying areas. It is also found in forest clearings, along margins and tracks of rainforests and in open forests where soils may be sandy and well drained (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Friend 1983; Flanagan 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Smith 2002; National Herbarium of New South Wales 2008).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Knobweed is generally a problem in pastures that are low in nitrogen or are overgrazed (Flanagan 1998). It has a peculiar odour and bitter taste which making it unattractive to stock and thus reduces available grazing area. This results in the more palatable species being grazed preferentially, which encourages the spread of Knobweed. It is particularly persistent in degraded pastures, since the large reserves in the rootstock permit the weed to resprout faster than pasture species, even if damaged, which also reduces pasture competitiveness (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nKnobweed invades cultivated areas and is a common weed of other disturbed areas such as roadsides and creek banks (Friend 1983; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nOnce established, Knobweed's resilience to slashing and mowing and its prolific seeding ensure that it will remain troublesome (Flanagan 1998). Because it produces large quantities of seeds, when areas are cleared to establish pasture or other uses, Knobweed infestations may arise in these disturbed areas (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nKnobweed seed has been found as a contaminant in seed of Siratro and stylo (Friend 1983).\n\nImpacts on biodiversity in native vegetation can occur where Knotweed has invaded open eucalypt forest and rainforests. In these situations, Knobweed usually invades in openings, e.g., along tracks and edges of forest or after disturbance (Smith 2002; Kodela 2008 pers. comm.)",
    "controlMethods": "New infestations of single plants or small groups can be manually removed. They should be grubbed before flowering and burnt, taking care to cut the root well below the crown (where stem and root join) to prevent re-establishment from the perennial rootstock (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nLarger colonies on good pasture should be slashed before flowering and the young regrowth treated with herbicides, followed with nitrogen fertiliser to promote rapid pasture growth that can then out-compete Knobweed. Degraded pastures will require resowing. After slashing Knobweed, the area can be cultivated ready for sowing. Weed regrowth can be sprayed on the fallow, followed by the application of fertiliser and sowing of a pasture suited to the district. Chemical spraying should be carried out before flowering (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Based on the documented habitat preferences for Tutsan and Stinking Tutsan (Guinochet & deVilmoria 1982), Tall Tutsan probably occurs in France in moist shaded places and on the edges of streams (Reid 2008 pers. obs.). These are generally similar to habitats invaded in south-eastern Australia by Tutsan (Walsh 1996).

If it does eventually naturalise in Australia, it is expected to occur in moist shaded sites leading to speculation that its impacts may be similar to, but not necessarily as severe as, those of its parent species (Reid 2008 pers. obs.). In south-eastern Australia, the 'parent' plant Tutsan invades cool, moist forests and streamsides, and forms dense closed stands that smother and out-compete native ground flora and smaller shrubs and prevent the regeneration of native vegetation (Walsh 1996; Muyt 2001).",

Plants can be hand-pulled or dug out ensuring that the roots are removed to prevent regrowth. Any pulled, dug or cut plant material with semi-ripe or ripe fruit should be disposed of carefully. Large patches in agricultural areas are best ploughed in autumn and cultivated whenever new growth appears (Parsons and Cuthbertson 1992; Muyt 2001, both references relate to Tutsan).\n\nChemical control: In situations where physical control is difficult or where minimal soil disturbance is desired, plants can be treated using the Cut-Paint method. This involves cutting plants back to near ground level and painting the cut stems with a suitable herbicide. Tutsan (one of the 'parent' species) can be sprayed with selective or non-selective herbicides with selective herbicides likely to provide better results (Muyt 2001, reference relates to Tutsan).

    "impact": "St Peter's Wort is one of seventeen sleeper weeds identified by the Bureau of Rural Sciences (following consultation with the Australian Weeds Committee) which could have nationally significant impacts on agriculture if allowed to spread.\n\nSt Peter's Wort is thought to be poisonous to stock and cause toxicity problems in the same manner as St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum). However, cases of St Peter's Wort poisoning have not been recorded in Australia (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nAgriculture: It is capable of forming dense populations especially on the banks of water courses and may encroach into moist pasture and grassland (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is not yet as extensively naturalised or as aggressive as the related Tutsan (Hypericum androsaemum) and St John's Wort, although, without management has the potential to become more problematic (Muyt 2002). Whilst unlikely to establish in regularly cultivated areas, it has demonstrated a capacity to invade pasture in southern Tasmania. Whilst this effect is likely to be limited to poorly maintained pastures, the consequence of land owners failing to control the plant would include a larger source of seed for potential distribution to natural areas.\n\nNative ecosystems: St Peter's Wort is not commonly described as invasive in natural environments but may displace native riparian species in disturbed situations. Groves et al. (2003) lists it as an environmental weed. It is recorded as a potential threat to one or more native vegetation formations in Victoria (Carr et al. 1992).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Land management: Cultivation is effective in controlling St Peter's Wort but it must be implemented thoroughly to minimise regrowth. Good pasture management enables competition from pastures to inhibit seedlings and regrowth.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides have been effective in controlling this weed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",

    "habitat": "St John's Wort is found mainly in water catchment reserves and hilly, forested areas, as well as on roadsides, intermittently grazed areas, railway land, riverbanks and in pastures. When on farmland, it is mostly associated with non-arable land. It is not common on well-managed pastures, especially those with vigorous growth of improved pasture species. The most vigorous infestations occur at altitudes of approximately 600 m with an annual rainfall exceeding 760 mm. However, the plant is widespread over a range of climates, although low temperatures inhibit seed germination and seedling survival. High summer temperature also impacts negatively on the weed's performance. The plant thrives in areas that receive either winter or summer rainfall. It grows on a wide range of soils (Campbell et al. 1995).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "St John's Wort was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, St John's Wort was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: St John's Wort contains hypericin, a photodynamic compound that reacts to light, causing photosensitization (i.e. skin irritation). Hypericin also has negative effects on animal behaviour and organ function. Although St John's Wort is usually avoided by grazing animals, they will consume it when other feed is scarce. Ingestion can cause weight loss, failure to gain weight, reduced wool and milk production, and reduced reproductive performance. Some livestock will die because of grazing St John's Wort (Bourke 1997). Horses are more susceptible than other forms of livestock. For a detailed discussion on the effects of St John's Wort on animal health, see Bourke (1997).\n\nIn pastures, St John's Wort displaces useful vegetation (Campbell et al. 1995) and, if left to establish, can eliminate almost all other plants. Large and dense infestations have led to the abandonment of formerly productive areas in north-eastern Victoria and in New South Wales. It is not as problematic on arable land as continued cultivation does not allow for conditions conducive to invasion of the weed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: In summer, the masses of dry stems that are left standing can become a fire hazard (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). St John's Wort also invades native habitats. In these situations, its impacts are largely unknown, although it is assumed that the species would have a significant impact on native flora and fauna (Cullen et al. 1997).\n\nHuman impacts: Preparations containing St John's Wort are used medicinally, although these can affect the way some prescription medicines work. For further information, consult your doctor or for general information see the Australian Therapeutic Goods Association (http://www.tga.gov.au/docs/html/sjwinfo.htm). Fact sheets that discuss the negative impacts of St John's Wort include Naughton & Bourke (2005) and Briese et al. (2000).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Land management: St John's Wort is sensitive to competition, particularly when plants are young. Good pasture management, which favours the growth of desirable species, can have significant impact on the success of St John's Wort. Overstocking encourages the weed as livestock tend to prefer other species, reducing competition.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can be used in the management of St John's Wort. Numerous fact sheets and handbooks have been produced in Australia that discuss the management techniques for controlling St John's Wort. For further information on chemical, physical and biological control, see Briese et al. (2000), Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001), Bowcher (2003), Naughton & Bourke (2005), Beer & Bourke (2005), Holding (2006) and Department of Agriculture and Food (2007). Alternatively, contact the relevant weed management agency in your area.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nBiological control: of St John's Wort in Australia has a long history, commencing over 80 years ago. Six biological control agents have become established in Australia. Two of these, a chrysolina leaf beetle (Chrysolina quadrigemina) and the St John's Wort Mite (Aculus hyperici), have shown potential to contribute to the control of St John's Wort (Briese 1997). See also Keith Turnbull Research Institute (1999) and Keith Turnbull Research Institute (2000) for specific information on the Chrysolina Leaf Beetle and the St John's Wort Mite respectively.

As long as sufficient moisture is available, it can establish in conditions ranging from deeply shaded to open and sunny. It invades disturbed and undisturbed sites, particularly in cool, moist forests, along roadsides and beside watercourses. It also spreads to pastures adjoining forests. Tutsan infests southern slopes more frequently than northern slopes, probably because it is more tolerant of shade than other plants (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Walsh 1996; Muyt 2001).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Tutsan is rated a very serious threat to native vegetation in damp and wet sclerophyll forest, riparian vegetation, warm temperate rainforest and cool temperate rainforest (Carr et al. 1992). Infestations spread rapidly and can form dense closed stands that smother and out-compete native species, including those forming the ground layer and smaller shrubs, and also inhibit the regeneration of native vegetation (Muyt 2001).\n\nAgriculture: Tutsan invades pastures, especially when they have been overgrazed, and may lead to the weed out-competing and displacing most other plants (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). It was regarded as the cause of death of cattle in Auckland, New Zealand, but feeding trials indicated it was unpalatable and it was concluded that in general it must be regarded as non-toxic (Connor 1977).",

This involves cutting plants back to near ground level and painting the cut stems with a suitable herbicide. Any pulled, dug or cut plant material with semi-ripe or ripe fruit should be disposed of safely. Tutsan can also be sprayed with selective or non-selective herbicides but selective herbicides generally provide better results. Avoid using herbicide treatments in winter when Tutsan is semi-dormant (Muyt 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Tall Tutsan fruits are more or less oval in outline with domed or pointed tops whereas Tutsan has more or less spherical fruits with flattish or slightly depressed tops (Webb et al. 1988). Rose of Sharon (H. calycinum) is a subshrub with similar leaves to Tutsan but much larger flowers (7-9 cm wide). Canary Island St. John's Wort (H. canariense) is taller (to 2 m high) than Tutsan and has much narrower leaves (mostly less than one cm wide). Square-stem St. John's Wort (H. tetrapterum) is a herb, or subshrub, with square stems. Tutsan has cylindrical stems. St. John's Wort (H. perforatum) and Tangled Hypericum (H. triquetrifolium) are both herbs with narrow leaves that are usually well under one cm wide (Walsh 1996; Reid 2008 pers. obs., Webb et al. 1988).\n\nIt may be necessary to consult an expert to correctly identify specimens to species level – contact the herbarium in your state or territory.",

Coolatai grass (Hyparrhenia hirta) is an invasive drought, fire and herbicide tolerant tussock forming perennial grass. It has become a major invasive species in northern New South Wales (NSW) and southern Queensland, dominating pastures over a range of soil types and conditions. It is also one of the few perennial grasses capable of invading undisturbed natural ecosystems and is a major threat to natural biodiversity in stock routes, nature reserves and National Parks. Pasture dominated by Coolatai Grass can be productive, although the management requirements are higher than that commonly employed (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nAgriculture: It impacts on grazing by dominating paddocks which are not intensively grazed or managed and although stock will graze fresh leaf growth they avoid older growth. Selective grazing by stock of more palatable grasses assists Coolatai Grass to become dominant in pastures (McCormick & Lodge 1991; Lodge & McCormick 1995; Lodge et al. 2005). DPI NSW (2019) state the following: Coolatai Grass readily invades pastures and dominates them, particularly where ground cover is low (less than 70%) due to the grazing regime (set stocking) and low soil fertility. Failure to appropriately manage a Coolatai grass dominated pasture will see a monoculture of tall rank growth of low digestibility (<40%) and protein (<7%). Sheep production will be poor and cattle will need supplementary nitrogen or protein to be able to utilise the feed. Most graziers feel that if you don’t already have Coolatai grass you don’t want it as there are more easily managed perennial and annual pasture options available. On the other hand, studies have shown that with significant management inputs where Coolatai grass is kept short, it can be a highly productive pasture and meet the feed requirement of dry stock. Coolatai grass also has the benefit of not having damaging seeds like wiregrasses (Aristida spp.) and corkscrew grass (Austrostipa spp.), however there are other more easily managed tropical perennial pasture species available that also have benign seed. If large areas have been dominated by Coolatai Grass, management strategies of rotational grazing, spring burning and/or slashing will be essential. The maintenance of a legume component in a Coolatai Grass dominated pasture is difficult.\n\nNative ecosystems: Coolatai grass poses a huge risk to the biodiversity of the fragmented areas of native ecosystems remaining  as it easily invades relatively undisturbed ecosystems being only one of few grasses to invade a wide range of intact native variegation. Coolatai Grass impacts on biodiversity by out competing and replacing native plants, preventing their regeneration and reducing available fauna habitat. It creates a fire hazard by producing large amounts of dry material resulting in a large fuel load (AMLR NRM undated). In a survey carried out in Kwiambal National Park, New South Wales the total number of species and number of native species was considerably lower in plots heavily infested with Coolatai Grass compared with plots relatively uninfested with the grass (McArdle et al. 2004). In regions where Coolatai Grass is widespread, sites of high biodiversity value should be a priority for control measures (CRC 2007).\n\nAreas of linear remnant vegetation such as road side reserves and railway lines are particularly prone to infestation due to their long edge to area ratio and their proximity the moving traffic (McArdle et al. 2004). Remnant grassy box woodlands in southern Australia are being threatened by the invasion of Coolatai Grass (CRC 2007). Indirectly, invasion of Coolatai Grass changes the nutrient and water cycle, and alters fire regimes (McArdle et al. 2004).\n\nUrban areas: Also invades areas in and around towns, on urban fringes, roadsides and other transport corridors, colonising bare and degraded areas, lawns and disturbed sites.",
    "controlMethods": "Coolatai Grass should be accurately identified before control measures are undertaken. The greatest problem with invasive species like Coolatai Grass is the lack of early detection and management. Grasses are particularly difficult because they look innocuous and rarely raise land managers’ attention until the species is well established. This is because most grasses look much the same to the untrained eye. Coolatai Grass is an invasive undesirable species and new occurrences must be correctly identified and controlled. In any management program, infestations should be mapped and early efforts directed at lightly infested areas, working back toward more heavily infested areas (DPI NSW 2019). As seed viability is only two years, when Coolati Grass is removed from a site, and germinating seedlings killed before seed set, with no further seeds transported to the area, an are can be become Coolatai free in two three years.\n\nNon-chemical control: Small infestations of the grass can be grubbed out. A single dose of herbicide may not kill mature Coolatai Grass tussocks, but combining physical and chemical treatment can be effective. Correct timing is essential when removing weedy grass species (CRC 2007). The spread of the grass along roadsides could be reduced by modifying maintenance activities. For example, grass trash and seed could be removed from slashers and graders before they move from infested to uninfested areas or slashing could occur before the grass flowers (McArdle et al. 2004). It appears unlikely that grazing could be used as a management strategy to completely remove the grass from pasture and heavily infested properties will need to learn to manage the grass to achieve adequate levels of production. Where it has not yet invaded intensive effort should be undertaken to prevent it from doing so (Lodge et al. 2005). Intensive grazing will reduce the biomass of the grass but will not control the infestation and may disadvantage native species (McArdle et al. 2004).\n\nFire: Anecdotal evidence suggests that fire may encourage the spread of the plant. Fire is known to reduce the bulk of grassy weeds but it can also increase their rate of invasion and density (Milberg & Lamont 1995) and fire can be used with other follow-up treatment.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides are useful to spot remove infestations of grassy weeds before seed set but Coolatai Grass is resistant to many of them (Lodge et al. 1994). Herbicides are most effective for the control of Coolatai Grass when used in two carefully timed applications after a pre-application burning. Coolatai Grass is therefore perceived by landholders as difficult to control. Burning and mowing may spread an infestation or make it denser if used alone. However, heavy, constant grazing over a few years can provide control. A combination of chipping and spraying is used to control Coolatai Grass in native vegetation, allowing native regeneration to exclude the weed. Persistent Coolatai Grass forms tough long-lived perennial tussocks that resist grazing and resprout after burning. There is likely to be a seed bank formed with seedlings appearing for at least a few years after tussocks are sprayed out (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nPlease see Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018); DPI NSW (2019);  the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "habitat": "Hymenachne thrives in wetter tropical and sub-tropical environments, where it is a weed of swamps, wetlands, seasonally flooded areas, waterways, riverbanks, drainage channels and other water bodies. It is also quite common in sugar-growing areas, where it is known to invade plantations (Navie 2007).\n\nAs a semi-aquatic grass, Hymenachne thrives best on clay soils that are inundated during the wet season rains but dry out to some extent in the dry season. The subsoil must remain moist during the dry season, as Hymenachne can only withstand short periods of drought. Because it grows so rapidly, it flourishes in wetlands that receive sediment and nutrient-rich water. However it does not tolerate brackish water and does not grow well in shaded areas (CRC 2003).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Hymenachne is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS) and is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, economic and environmental impacts. Since escaping from cultivation in recent years it has seriously threatened the wetlands of northern Australia. Hymenachne invades permanent water bodies and seasonally inundated wetlands. It blocks waterways, potentially causing flooding, threatening drinking water and also blocks drainage and irrigation channels in cropping areas (CRC 2003).\n\nThe environmental threats posed to wetlands are severe, as Hymenachne forms dense stands that displace native water plant species. By forming floating mats, these stands also reduce available habitat for native animals (Wearne et al. 2010). Compared to native vegetation, Hymenachne stands exhibit lower species diversity of plants and of many groups of insects, whereas introduced fish are more abundant (Houston & Duivemvoorden 2002).\n\nIn the Northern Territory, infestations have been found in important conservation areas including the Mary River and Kakadu National Parks, and at Murganella on the Cobourg Peninsula. The potential exists for Hymenachne to severely detract from the high conservation and tourism value of such natural wetland systems in northern Australia. The potential loss of natural wildlife resources (such as fish and waterfowl) to indigenous people is an impact that has social, environmental and economic consequences. It also has the potential to cause severe impacts on the sugar cane industry, by reducing the quality of crops and infesting drainage and irrigation channels. In one reported case, an infestation in a cane crop caused a 50% reduction in the price of the sugar (CRC 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Chemical control: Several herbicides currently used in Queensland to control Hymenachne have been approved for use under ‘off-label’ minor use permits. A variety of application methods can be used, including spraying by hand, boom or helicopter. Spraying must be repeated about every three months to control regrowth (CRC 2003).\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical or physical removal is difficult because of Hymenachne’s ability to reproduce vegetatively from very small pieces. Mechanical harvesters have been used to remove Hymenachne and other aquatic weeds from deeper waters in the Burdekin Shire in Queensland, but this requires ongoing control efforts on a monthly basis. In drier regions, constant heavy grazing has been used to remove Hymenachne from ponded pasture systems (Land Protection 2006). Flooding can offer some control, particularly when above-ground Hymenachne vegetation has recently been removed, making it impossible for the plant to keep up with rising water levels (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: There is ongoing research into a biological control agent that will attack the introduced Hymenachne, but not other species such as the closely related native Hymenachne (Hymenachne acutigluma). Most insects found on Hymenachne in Australia are also found on native Hymenachne (Bell et al. 2011). However, a blissid bug (Ischnodemus variegatus) found in invasive Hymenachne populations in Florida seems to be highly specific for this species and hardly affects native Hymenachne (Diaz et al. 2009).\n\nCheck with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for Hymenachne control.

    "controlMethods": "Control of Hygrophila is very difficult as new infestations can form from any remaining pieces of the plant (NSW DPI, 2020). Correct disposal of plant parts is important for limiting spread; all plants should be carefully handled and bagged (Pritchard 2004).\n\nChemical control: Some herbicides are effective, but care must be taken when using herbicides near waterways (Pritchard 2004).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand removal of isolated plants is beneficial, but large scale hand removal of larger infestations may cause damage to native vegetation or aquatic ecosystems. Planting large shading trees can reduce the growth of Hygrophila by shading and competition. Preventing animal or mechanical access to infested areas should reduce the spread of seed or other plant parts (Pritchard 2004).",
    "origin": "Hygrophila is native to North, Central and South America (Navie 2004).",
    "growthForm": "Herb, Aquatic",
    "similarSpecies": "Hygrophila can be confused with the native species Hygrophila angustifolia but the latter species is a smaller plant (15-45 cm compared to up to 90 cm) with very narrow leaves (2-8 mm wide compared to 20 mm), and relatively large fruit (10-18 mm long compared to 6-8 mm) (Navie 2004; Barker 2008 pers. comm.).\n\nHygrophila is also similar to Senegal Tea Plant (Gymnocoronis spilanthoides) but the latter species has somewhat hollow stems and leaves with finely-toothed edges. These traits are not present in Hygrophila (Navie 2004).\n\nDyschoriste depressa has only relatively recently been recognised from the Brisbane area. It occupies similar habitat to Hygrophila and could be easily confused with it since it has the same clusters of flowers and fruits in the axils. However, Dyschoriste depressa has distinct bristles at the base of each of the male reproductive parts of the flower and fruit which contain only four seeds (Barker 2008 pers. comm.).",

    "habitat": "Hydrilla is widespread in a variety of primarily warm freshwater habitats and is most common in tropical and temperate regions. It usually found in still or slow-moving water, such as creeks, rivers, irrigation channels, lakes, lagoons, ponds, wetlands and seasonally inundated swamps. It is often found in habitats subjected to occasional flooding and tolerates a great deal of disturbance (Sainty & Jacobs 1981, 2003; Cook & Lüönd 1982; Stanley & Ross 1989; Jacobs 1993; Holm et al. 1997; Cowie et al. 2000; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Hydrilla is tolerant of cool and brackish waters and it is often found in the lower reaches and upper estuaries of coastal streams. It can grow in water varying from a few centimetres to 12 m deep. Although it tolerates a wide range of nutrient levels, it grows better on more fertile muds than on sands, and growth is also enhanced under conditions of increased nutrient levels, for example where there is runoff from agriculture. Hydrilla is also affected by pH changes, temperature and variation in day length, light intensity and light quality (Swarbrick et al. 1995; Holm et al. 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Hydrilla is a native species and is rarely a problem in Australia in healthy aquatic environments (Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water 2008).\n\nIt is usually ecologically beneficial to habitats e.g., a stable population will improve water quality and provides protective habitat for juvenile fish, except where environmental changes occur, such as increased nutrient status. Nutrient enrichment of waters often leads to greatly increased growth rates, rapid spread and the formation of dense masses of intertwined stems. Hydrilla can become an aggressive weed that restricts water movement and interferes with hydroelectric systems, urban water supplies, its extensive growth can clog the filters of irrigation pumps in irrigation projects, congest flood control canals and natural streams and cause flooding, block piers and tangle in boat motors and affect recreational activities, including most water sports such as swimming, fishing, sailing and motor-boating. It can clog rivers, choke channels and also reduce the holding capacity of storage ponds and dams, leading to the loss of urban and agricultural water supplies (Swarbrick et al. 1995; Holm et al. 1997; Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Balciunas et al. 2002; Stephens & Dowling 2002; Global Invasive Species Database 2006).\n\nDense stands can alter water quality by decreasing oxygen levels and increasing pH and water temperature (Global Invasive Species Database 2006).\n\nDense colonies of Hydrilla reduce sport fishing by reducing the open-water feeding and spawning areas for fish. It also affects the recreational use and tourism potential of waterways as dense masses clog waterways and impede boat passage (Cronk & Fennessy 2001).\n\nHydrilla can be invasive and impact on other native biodiversity. It can form a dense canopy at the water's surface that shades growth in the water column below, while large mats crowd out other aquatic plants and reduce habit for wildlife (Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Sainty & Jacobs 2003; Weber 2003). Single species stands of Hydrilla may occur due to plants releasing allelopathic substances, chemicals that inhibit the growth of other plant species (Gopal & Goel 1993; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "Since Hydrilla usually becomes weedy in response to the human-induced problem of nutrient enhancement, this factor needs to be addressed to effectively control the weed. When the cause of the environmental change has been appropriately managed, there are various controls that can be attempted if the infestation remains a problem (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nMechanical removal methods such as the use of booms, disking, dredging, hydraulic excavators, draglines, or cutting by hand or pulling can only provide temporary relief as they actually increase the spread of Hydrilla populations by fragmenting plants which gives rise to new plants. Mechanical methods are also slow and costly and can reduce fish numbers significantly (Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In some situations, a more effective control may be possible through the temporary lowering of water levels, such as draining dams, drains and channels (Swarbrick et al. 1995; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nHydrilla can be controlled effectively with several herbicides (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Gupta 1987; Swarbrick et al. 1995; Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Shearer & Nelson 2002; Weber 2003).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "It is uncertain where Hydrilla is truly native (Cook & Lüönd 1982), but it is generally considered to be a cosmopolitan species with an original distribution from parts of Europe to Africa, India, south-east Asia and Australia (Swarbrick et al. 1995; Cowie et al. 2000; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; PIER 2008).",
    "growthForm": "Aquatic, Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "There are a number of similar-looking submerged aquatic species that can grow in similar habitats. Differences between Hydrilla, which is characterised by having leaf margins that are distinctly serrated with fine translucent teeth, and the following introduced species, which are all in the family Hydrocharitaceae, include:\n\nDense Waterweed (Egeria densa); has more crowded leaves with finer serrations, and also differs in its large, up to 2 cm wide, 3-petalled white flowers\n\nElodea (Elodea canadensis); which has generally shorter leaves in whorls of 3 (rarely 4 or 5) with margins more finely serrated with minute dark-tipped teeth\n\nLagarosiphon (Lagarosiphon) has leaves that are spirally arranged around the stem rather than in whorls as in the other species (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Jacobs 1993; Bowmer et al. 1995; Romanowski 1998; Sainty & Jacobs 1981, 2003; Ramey 2001a, b; Richardson et al. 2006).\n\nWhen using vegetative parts for identification of Hydrilla it is important to be aware of the wide variation in its form and colour (Holm et al. 1997). A simple test to distinguish Hydrilla from Egeria densa and Elodea canadensis is to pull the foliage through your hand; the latter two feel smooth while Hydrilla feels harsh and scratchy (Yeo et al. 1984).",

    "habitat": "Buchan Weed is a common weed in south-eastern Australia, where it is most often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wasteland (Auld & Medd 1987, Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It also occurs in degraded pastures, orchards and vineyards (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Buchan Weed (Hirschfeldia incana) is a weed of open, disturbed habitats in natural, anthropogenic, and agricultural systems, mostly impacting agricultural Pasture and cropping but also a weed of orchards and vineyards. It is a  weed of disturbed urban areas such as roadsides, rail corridors, fence lines,  gardens and parks in the suburbs, yards and abandoned sites, and some disturbed natural environments.\n\nAgriculture: Buchan Weed is one of the crucifer (Brassicaceae) weeds that compete with broadacre crops and pasture in some situations. Buchan weed populations increase when broad-leaf crops, such as oilseed rape and vegetable seed are grown. In pastures it may be present but not obvious due to grazing. When these pastures are cultivated it may dominate unless controlled by grazing, cultivation or herbicides (Government of South Australia 2014). Buchan weed does not normally invade healthy pastures invading poor pastures and if eaten by stock, can taint meat and dairy products (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is normally only palatable when young, loosing palatability when flowering and fruiting. It can grow in dense stands replacing and limiting desirable species, and the amount of pasture available. It can sometimes be a serious competitor when growing amongst winter cereals, reducing yields as well as interfering with harvesting and contaminating harvested grain (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Also a weed forming dense stands in orchards and vineyards. It has the potential to become a major cropping weed in Victoria (Dellow et al. 2006)a and is regarded as one of the top nine Brassica weeds in South Australia (Dellow et al. 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: As Buchan Weed is  a weed of disturbed sites it does not normally invade intact native vegetation. However, it can invade disturbed open vegetation, examples being; creek-lines; grassy woodlands, open coastal dense; and especially on margins and tracks of  other native variegation types in agricultural areas where the weed is common.\n\nUrban areas: Invades roadsides, rail corridors, disturbed areas and parks.",
    "controlMethods": "Can be control by herbicides and physical and mechanical methods. Also prevention of seed onto un-infested areas employing good weed hygiene, and dense healthy pastures helps prevents establishment.\n\nChemical control: Chemical control of Buchan Weed can be successful (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) with only a a few herbicides provide effective control of this species, and several of the herbicides used on other annual and perennial members of the Brasicaceae are less effective on H. incana.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Single plants can be hand-pulled, but care must be taken to remove as much of the taproot as possible because plants readily re-shoot from pieces of root left in the soil (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nMechanical control: Deep ploughing effectively controls Buchan Weed by burying the taproot, with further cultivation usually required to control seedlings that subsequently emerge.\nCompetition and management: Sowing with a vigorous pasture species should prevent re-infestation (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Although neither method has been tested for the management of H. incana, grazing or prescribed burning are not expected to be effective for the control of this species (DiTommaso et al., 2013).",
    "origin": "Buchan Weed is native to the Mediterranean region (Hewson 1982).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Buchan Weed may be commonly mistaken for several other yellow flowered cruciferous (Brassica-like) species in the genera; Brassica, Diplotaxis, Raphanus, Rapistrum and Sinapis. The fruits of Buchan Weed are usually held against the stem and have a covering of stiff hairs. At the end of each fruit, there is small beak, which usually contains a single seed, this character gives the fruit a shape similar to an old fashioned clothes peg and is a character that should serve to differentiate it from other similar species. Various weed guides, including Richardson et al. (2006), Auld and Medd (1996), Hussey et al. (2007), Navie (2004) and various regional and state floras should be consulted for further information on differentiating between these species.",

It occurs in mountain areas with annual rainfall of 1000-2000 mm and a temperate continental climate of hot summers and cold winters (EPPO 2006). Where it is naturalised in North America, it is common along railways, roadsides, streams, rivers, uncultivated or wastelands and agricultural areas (USDA Forest Service undated).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Giant Hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) is a weed of natural areas including riparian (riverside) habitats, roadsides and amenity areas. It is highly toxic to humans, causing severe dermatitis and swelling and blistering of the skin.\n\nAgriculture: Giant Hogweed is not normally a weed of agriculture or crops, but there are reports of its encroachment into crop fields, such as potatoes in Sweden (Lundstrom 1984), and it has also been known to invade pastures (EPPO 2006). Giant Hogweed acts as a host for some crop pests and diseases.\n\nNative ecosystems:  In Europe, Giant Hogweed has negative impacts on biodiversity and the environment in general, Giant Hogweed is an aggressive competitor, which is able to out-compete native plant species, reducing the amount of suitable habitat available for insects, birds and mammals (EPPO 2006). When it dies back during the winter months, it leaves bare ground. This can lead to an increase in soil erosion on riverbanks and steep slopes (Davies 2008).\n\nUrban areas: Known to grow on urban fringes and in urban riparian areas Giant Hogweed is toxic to humans, the sap can cause severe photo-sensitivity of the skin, impacting human health, native flora and tourism (EPPO 2006). It contains a substance within its sap that makes the skin sensitive to ultraviolet light. This can result in severe burns to the affected areas, producing swelling and severe, painful blistering (Davies 2008). In other areas of the world dense infestations of the weed can lower the recreational value of the landscape and seriously interfere with access to amenity areas and river banks. Along roadsides, large stands can reduce visibility and result in a safety hazard.",
    "controlMethods": "In Europe, Giant Hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) can be controlled by herbicides if applied early in the growing season. Other physical and cultural control methods are also used, and best employed on young rosetted plants before they flower. However, with these persistent and difficult to control plants, an integrated management program should be employed, with 2–4 visits required per year for several years. A coordinated approach should be employed with local government staff.\n\nChemical control: Spraying Giant Hogweed with an appropriate herbicide is the most effective control option, although it can take several years of repeated treatments to eradicate. Spraying can only be carried out during the growing season when there is green, leafy material present. In order to be effective, spraying must be carried out before the plant flowers and sets seed. Seeds can remain in the soil for several years, so a long-term strategy for treatment with herbicide is required (Davies 2008).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Removal of smaller individual plants should be carried out with full Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) to avoid contact with skin and eyes, as contact with the plant can cause serve dermatitis. All roots and underground buds should be removed as these can form new plants  If plants have seeded then topsoil within a 4-m radius can be removed around Giant Hogweed plants as seeds fall within a 4-meter radius of the parent.\n\nMechanical control: Mechanical cutting is frequently used to clear river banks, but provides no long-term control, as there is rapid re-growth from below ground, and it may encourage additional flowering shoots.  A quicker method of removing larger infestations of Giant Hogweed involves mechanical removal clearing of above ground leaf/stem material, and the additional removal of below ground material contaminated with seeds within a 4-m radius around Giant Hogweed plants and removal of  underground buds preventing the formation of new plants. Any regrowth should be treated with an appropriate herbicide (Davies 2008).  Follow-up will be required in many cases for several years.\n\nCompetition and management: Grazing has proved to be very efficient for the control of large stands of Giant Hogweed. In principle, the effect of grazing is similar to cutting. Sheep and cattle prefer young plants, and the most efficient control is obtained by beginning the grazing when the plants are small (Nielsen et al. 2005). Intensive grazing, especially by sheep has provided good control, and the rooting of pigs can also be highly effective (Tiley et al., 1996). Anderson & Calov (1996) reported on a 5-year study in Denmark in which the population of the weed was much reduced after 2 years of sheep grazing and completely eliminated after 5 years, when no viable seeds were found to remain in the soil. The weed may be slightly less palatable to cattle, but grazing by cattle as well as pigs is recommended in Ireland (Lucey 1994).",

    "habitat": "Blue Heliotrope is a weed of warm temperate, subtropical and sometimes also semi arid regions of Australia. It has been recorded growing on many different soil types (Craven 1996), invading pastures, crops and fallows, roadsides, turf, disturbed sites and waste places (Craven 1996; Navie 2004). The major infestations in New South Wales occur in areas that receive more than 500 mm of rainfall per year, although it is also established areas that receive less (Dellow et al. 2004).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: Blue Heliotrope can compete successfully with desirable crop and pasture species (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Zapater et al. 2004). It has shown a remarkable ability to recover and spread after periods of drought (Dellow et al. 2004; NSW DPI 2007), when it very quickly out-competes desirable species for both moisture and nutrients (NSW DPI 2007). It is recognised as a problem species in sugar cane crops in Queensland (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nBlue Heliotrope contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are toxic to livestock; accumulations of these alkaloids may cause a decline in animal performance and may even result in death of livestock (Glover & Ketterer 1987).",
    "controlMethods": "Chemical control: Application of herbicide to Blue Heliotrope can provide effective control (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). However, the chemicals currently registered for Blue Heliotrope have had limited success and are not selective (Briese et al. 2000; Briese & Zapater 2001; Zapater et al. 2004, CSIRO Entomology 2007). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Effective control of seedlings in spring and summer can be achieved by cultivation (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001), although this may stimulate germination of dormant seeds, spread root fragments of mature plants and encourage regeneration from the rootstocks of harvested plants (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nA combination of control techniques including mechanical cultivation, herbicide application and good pasture management are necessary to manage Blue Heliotrope on arable land (Dellow et al. 2004).\n\nBiological control: Blue Heliotrope has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. A biological control project for Blue Heliotrope in Australia began in 1998 with the search for potential natural enemies (Briese et al. 2000, Briese & Zapater 2001, Zapater et al. 2004). The leaf-beetle (Deuterocampta quadrijuga) was approved for release as a biological control agent of Blue Heliotrope in July 2001 (Briese & Zapater 2001).\n\nIn addition, the Flea Beetle (Longitarsus sp.) has shown potential as being a useful control agent against Blue Heliotrope in Australia (Zapater et al. 2004).",
    "origin": "Blue Heliotrope is native to South America, where it is found in northern and central Argentina, southern Bolivia, Uruguay and the extreme south of Brazil (Johnston 1928).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Blue Heliotrope (Heliotropium amplexicaule) is distinguished from other native and non-native Heliotropium species that occur in Australia by the presence of glandular hairs in the stems and leaves, the attenuate base of the leaf blade (i.e. tapering to a narrow point at the base of the leaf), and especially by the two hairless nutlets (Craven 1996).\n\nBlue Heliotrope may also be confused with some of the low-growing Verbena species, which have similar tubular flowers. Veined Verbena (Verbena rigida) can be differentiated from Blue Heliotrope by its coarse-textured and serrated leaves, while Mayne's Pest Glandularia aristigera [as Verbena aristigera] has highly divided leaves. Also, neither of these species has the coiled inflorescence present in Blue Heliotrope (Navie 2004).",

It grows naturally in low densities in native grasslands, but thrives in cultivated or heavily disturbed areas. It also inhabits roadsides, streams and ditch banks, and open drainage areas, often preferring alkaline and saline soils. It occurs from 10–2600 m above sea level (Kearney et al. 1964; Martin & Hutchins 1981; Cronquist 1994; Schilling 2006; California Department of Food and Agriculture undated).\n\nHabitat notes from specimens held at the National Herbarium of New South Wales record the species growing in a cultivated paddock, a moist gully on roadside in coarse, light-textured soil and in grey loam wheat soils (National Herbarium of New South Wales 2008).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: In the United States of America, Texas Blueweed is highly competitive in several crops and cropping systems, including cotton, wheat, and sorghum (California Department of Food and Agriculture undated). There is virtually no published information about the impact of Texas Blueweed on the environment or agriculture in Australia. At Milford, in Queensland, it was recorded as densely infesting 4 acres in a paddock in 1951, but there are no subsequent records from this area (Queensland Herbarium 2008).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Physical control: In the United States of America, isolated plants of Texas Blueweed and small infestations are physically hand pulled, hoed or grubbed, and the site is monitored over several years to ensure that any resprouting plants are destroyed. In pasture situations, Texas Blueweed can be prevented from establishing by maintaining a vigorous, competitive pasture. Texas Blueweed is grazed when young, but tends to be avoided by stock as it matures. Overgrazing of the pasture by stock encourages the growth of Texas Blueweed (California Department of Food and Agriculture undated) and should therefore be avoided.\n\nMechanical control: Because Texas Blueweed is spread by root fragments, mechanical disturbance of infestations will only exacerbate the problem. The movement of agricultural seeds, grain, forage, fodder, soil and machinery contaminated with seeds, and particularly root fragments, from infested areas to clean areas needs to be restricted (Stajsic pers.comm. 2008).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides probably provide the most effective means of controlling Texas Blueweed. In the United States of America, several herbicides have been reported as effective in controlling the species. These herbicides need to be applied during the growing season of the plant (California Department of Food and Agriculture undated).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

The leaves of Common Sunflower are rough, with firm, stiff hairs, and those of Jerusalem Artichoke are rough to touch being covered with minute, stiff hairs on the upper surface, and softly hairy on the lower surface. Texas Blueweed also has smaller flower heads, 8–10 mm across, compared with 2–8 cm or wider in the Common Sunflower and the Jerusalem Artichoke, which also have longer petal-like segments (20–40 mm, compared with 8–10 mm in Texas Blueweed (Murray 1992).",

    "description": "",
    "leaves": "",
    "flowers": "",
    "fruit": "",
    "reproduction": "",
    "habitat": "English Ivy occurs in temperate to subtropical climates where it grows in wet sclerophyll forest or disturbed rainforest, coastal areas, salt marsh edges, and other upland areas, especially where some soil moisture is present, on a variety of substrates. It will grow in variable light conditions but prefers shade, damp soils, and a moist, cool environment (GISD 2005; Henwood & Makinson 1999-2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: English Ivy is an aggressive invader that threatens all vegetation levels of forested and open areas, growing along the ground as well as into the forest canopy. It excludes the native vegetation and results in a loss of biodiversity. The dense growth and abundant leaves, which spring from the stems like small umbrellas, form a thick canopy just above the ground and prevent sunlight from reaching other plants. Vines climbing up tree trunks spread, surround and cover branches and twigs, preventing most of the sunlight from reaching the leaves of the host tree thus reducing photosynthesis. It covers growing tips, and thus disrupts the tree's growth, first on branch tips and eventually at the tree top. The impacts on photosynthesis and growth may also result in damage to the root system, since the tree can no longer provide the necessary level of nutrition to the roots. Loss of host tree vigour, evident within a few years, is followed by death a few years later. The added weight of vines makes infested trees susceptible to blow-over during storms (DPI 2004; GISD 2005; Swearingen & Diedrich 2006).\n\nHuman impacts: It also has poisonous foliage and its flower pollen can irritate eyes. The leaves and berries of English Ivy contain the glycoside hederin which could cause toxicosis if ingested. As symptoms can include gastrointestinal upset and diarrhoea this feature may aid effective dispersal by birds, ensuring consumed seeds pass quickly through their digestive systems (DPI 2004; GISD 2005; Swearingen & Diedrich 2006).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Physical control: English Ivy vines growing as groundcover can be pulled up by hand, with some difficulty. Remove all stem parts from the ground as they will take root and regrow. If removal from site is difficult ensure vines are placed off the ground (on branches or a platform) to dry out and decompose. Alternatively, seal in strong bags and dispose as rubbish.\n\nMulching may be an effective choice for smaller infestations when herbicides are not appropriate. Cover the entire infestation with several inches of mulch. This may include wood chips, grass clippings, hay or similar degradable plant material. Shredded or chipped wood may be the best option since hay and grass may potentially carry weed seeds. Covering the area with cardboard may improve the effectiveness and longevity of this method. The mulch should stay in place for at least two growing seasons and may need to be augmented several times. Mulching can also be done following herbicide treatment.\n\nMechanical control: Vines climbing up into the tree canopy are more difficult to manage and should be cut to a comfortable height to kill upper portions and relieve the tree canopy.\n\nChemical control: Because it is an evergreen vine and remains active during the winter, herbicide applications can be made at any time of year as long as temperatures are above 12 or 15 degrees Celsius for a few days. Repeat herbicidal treatments are usually necessary and follow-up monitoring should be conducted to evaluate the success of treatments (DPI 2004; GISD 2005; Swearingen & Diedrich 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.",

    "growthForm": "Vine",
    "similarSpecies": "All, Ivy species are similar in appearance with wild species separated on based on leaf-shape and minute hairs on developing leaves. As many (1000s) cultivars (garden varieties), have been developed from ivy, especially English and Irish Ivy, over hundreds of years, leave's shapes have been greatly altered from wild types (shape), to the point that different species have overlapping and varying leaf sizes and shapes, making separating these taxa using leaf shape problematic to redundant. Identification is based  on leaf hairs and use of these the cryptic characters is challenging. Algerian ivy (Hedera algeriensis) has also been mistaken for English Ivy. For a comprehensive overview and taxonomic treatment of ivy species and information on cultivars, see: McAllister & Marshall, (2017), and for species in Australia see: Brodie et al. (2000); eFlora 2021; VicFlora (2016).\n\nEnglish Ivy is similar to the native Wonga Wonga Vine (Pandorea pandorana), which is a woody climber in forests, but its leaves are a different shape and its stems do not cling to the bark.\n\nThe native Common Silkpod (Parsonsia straminea) climbs tree trunks with aerial roots like English Ivy when young, but its leaves are not lobed. Mature plants lose this feature and climb by twining.\n\nThe weed Cape Ivy (Delairea odorata) has slightly similar lobed leaves but they are brighter green and the plant climbs by twining (DPI 2004; Eurobodalla Shire Council undated).",

It is a pioneer species, and one of the earliest colonisers of cleared forest, abundant in recent secondary growth (Palgrave 1984; Keay 1989).\n\nIn Queensland, Harungana invades cyclone-damaged forest, forest fringes, tracks, roadsides, drains and riparian habitats (Anon. 1995; Csurhes & Edwards 1998). It grows on well-drained soils and can withstand poor drainage on alluvium (Ward et al. 2001). It has assumed similar ecological niches as in its native range, and is restricted to areas with a similar rainfall as in its native range in Africa (Stajsic 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Harungana produces large numbers of seeds which germinate en masse, and rapidly establish themselves (Anon. 1995). It has invaded cyclone and logging damaged forest, forest fringes, roadsides, tracks, drains and riparian ecosystems (Csurhes & Edwards 1998; Anon. 1995; Vitelli & van Haaren 2001), forming dense thickets excluding native species, ultimately forming a monoculture over several hectares (Humphries et al. 1991; Humphries & Stanton 1992; Vitelli & van Haaren 2000), and destroying habitat for native fauna (Queensland Natural Resources and Water 2005a). Incursions have been discovered 2 ½ km into undisturbed rainforest, in small gaps created by tree falls and landslips (Anon. 1995).\n\nAlthough the current incursions are mostly restricted to the Babinda region, there is a potential for the species to increase its range to other areas with favourable climate and rainfall in tropical Australia (Natural Resources and Water Queensland 2005b). One of the reasons for this is its broad elevation tolerance in its natural range in Africa, which varies from sea level to 1800 metres. There are fears that over the next 20–30 years the species may invade the higher peaks of the Wooroonooran National Park. It has the possibility of becoming a permanent component of tropical rainforests (Csurhes & Edwards 1998) with the majority of the wet tropics at risk of invasion (Vitelli & van Haaren 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "There is little information available in relation to the control of Harungana. Control appears to be limited to either physically hand pulling or digging out seedlings and young trees or applying herbicide treatment (Vitelli & van Haaren 2001; PIER 2003).\n\nChemical control: Trees can be cut down, and the stumps should be treated with herbicide (PIER 2003). For regrowth (and presumably seedlings/saplings), foliar applied herbicides may be a cost effective option. For trees, the stem injection method may be the preferred option (Swarbrick 1993; Vitelli & van Haaren 2001). Treating plants with herbicide prior to flowering will also reduce flowering and hence fruit production (Vitelli & van Haaren 2001). A list of chemicals that can be used on Harungana can be found here https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/66457/harungana.pdf.\n\nThe rugged terrain of much of the Wet Tropics exacerbates the efforts required in detecting, controlling and monitoring incursions. Many areas are very difficult to access, and accessible only by foot, or four wheel drive motorbikes, or canoes and boats (Setter & Vitelli 2003).\n\nOngoing monitoring and follow up is an essential part of control (Stajsic 2007). An eradication program in the late 1990s treated approximately 60 % of the known incursions, by using the stem injection. However, the failure to follow-up on regrowth now sees it infesting many ridges and wherever storm damage has broken the forest canopy (Vitelli & van Haaren 2001).\n\nAny control should avoid mechanical disturbance to the site, which encourages seed germination.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Human impacts: Harrisia Cactus can cause painful injury to animals or humans who accidentally walk into or otherwise touch a plant due to the sharp spines.\n\nAgriculture: It is a prolific seeder, spreads quickly, and has the ability to eventually take over large areas of grazing country (Tanner 2007). If unchecked, it can form dense, tangled thickets that are impenetrable to stock, can choke out pasture species and can eventually cover as much as 80 to 90 percent of the land and seriously reduce productivity. The dense thickets also interfere with mustering operations. It is not readily grazed due to its spines except during drought.\n\nNative ecosystems: It can be a particular problem in brigalow areas where it may completely cover the ground surface. It competes strongly in the brigalow scrub under shaded and dry conditions but will can also grow, albeit slowly, in the full sun (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Control of Harrisia Cactus is difficult due to its deep underground tuberous root system. Small infestations and single plants should be completely removed as plants can grow from small sections of the tuberous root left behind in the soil (Land Protection 2007).\n\nFire: Burning can be undertaken for small infestations but intense heat is required to destroy underground parts (Tanner 2007).\n\nChemical control: is possible but must be regularly undertaken (Tanner 2007).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nBiological control: Harrisia Cactus has been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Biological control using the Stem Boring Beetle (Alcidion cereicola) has been successful in the Collinsville area. Large stem boring beetle colonies developed and contributed to the collapse of dense areas of cactus. The populations of this beetle have declined with the declining numbers of the cactus (Land Protection 2007). The Mealy Bug (Hypogeococcus festerianus) is the most successful biological control agent used on Harrisia Cactus. It is now widespread in affected areas in Queensland (Land Protection 2007). The Prickly Pear Moth Borer (Tucumania tapiacola) has also been observed attacking Harrisia Cactus (Land Protection 2006).",

Recent research has found that some herbicides that are absorbed through the roots from treated soil may be effective.

A mealy bug (Hypogeococcus festerianus) has been more successful in controlling Harrisia Cactus populations by feeding on the tips of stems and buds.

    "impact": "Senegal Tea Plant is on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 non native plants that threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage. Although only in the early stages of establishment, these weeds have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystem.\n\nNative ecosystems: Senegal Tea Plant poses a significant risk to the health of wetland ecosystems. It can quickly take over wetlands and detract from their environmental value, natural beauty and recreational potential. In New Zealand it has caused flooding by blocking streams and drainage channels. It could potentially infest wetlands throughout much of Australia. It has a wide climate tolerance and has been found in cultivation well outside its predicted range. It is also very difficult to control because it can spread by both seed and vegetative reproduction, with even tiny pieces of vegetation giving rise to new colonies. Because it is found mainly in water, the potential impact of herbicides on nontarget plants and animals is a potential risk (CRC 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Because there are relatively few Senegal Tea Plant infestations, and it can potentially be eradicated before it becomes established, any new outbreaks should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Do not try to control Senegal Tea Plant without their expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: Senegal Tea Plant is very hard to kill and herbicides effective on similar plants kill only the upper parts of the plant. Any material that is below the water line is not killed, and can regrow. Long-term experience with glyphosate has shown it is not an effective eradication tool. Some of the problems are that it is non-selective and also kills native species such as swamp grasses and sedges. It also has no residual effect which means it creates a gap which is flooded by light, an ideal seedbed for Senegal Tea Plant to re-grown. In addition, the plant fragments after toxin application, resulting in leaf abscission and propagule formation reused (CRC 2003; GISD 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand pulling often results in regeneration and further spread, but can be effective on small infestations. Mechanical control: Physical methods that include the use of heavy machinery combined with chemicals has been found to be effective. Infestations are sprayed with a herbicide to reduce the risk of spreading plant parts. Then 7-10 days later all silt and plant material up to a depth of 1 m is removed by heavy machinery. Depending on local weather conditions, all plant material is dead after about a month and the silt and soil can be reused (CRC 2003; GISD 2006).",

Flower heads are 15-20 mm in diameter and are white or purplish white and borne in clusters at the tips of the stems.\n\nHygrophila is a semi-aquatic plant with stems that are not hollow. Leaves have entire margins. Flowers are white about 10 mm in diameter and stalkless and are borne in small clusters in the leaf forks (axils).\n\nSiam Weed is a large terrestrial plant with stems that are not hollow. Leaves are egg shaped or triangular with slightly toothed margins.

    "habitat": "Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush grows in a wide range of environments including warm temperate, sub-tropical, tropical and occasionally even semi-arid regions. It is a weed of roadsides, disturbed sites, waste areas, waterways, pastures, open woodlands and fallows (Navie & Adkins 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nDense infestations of Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush can substantially reduce the productivity and grazing capacity of pastures. It is also poisonous to livestock and humans and has caused deaths in cattle, sheep and poultry. It is seldom consumed fresh by livestock, but may be dangerous if it contaminates fodder or chaff. Severe gastroenteritis is the main symptom of poisoning by this species. Contact with the sap can also cause skin rashes and other symptoms in humans (Lloyd & Peirce 2003).\n\nNarrow Leaf Cotton Bush is also regarded as an environmental weed in Western Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland (WWF 2006). It is a common weed of grasslands, open woodlands and disturbed sites and also invades riparian areas. It competes with native plants in these habitats and is capable of forming dense thickets. Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush is currently of utmost concern as an environmental weed in New South Wales and Western Australia, where it often invades conservation areas. For example, Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush was recently listed as a moderately important species in the Environmental Weed Strategy of Western Australia and was also listed among the top 20 priority environmental weed species in the Namoi Catchment, in the inland parts of northern New South Wales. It is also listed as a common environmental weed of the Adelaide region in South Australia (Navie & Adkins 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush has a shallow root system so small infestations can be dealt with by hand pulling or grubbing. However, care should be taken to remove the crown and as many roots as possible to minimise suckering. Material should also be disposed of carefully to prevent spreading the seeds. Appropriate measures should also be taken to avoid contact with the toxic sap, such as wearing rubber gloves and overalls, and washing hands thoroughly before eating (Lloyd & Peirce 2003, Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nLarger infestations are best dealt with by a combination of spraying herbicides, slashing and pasture management (Lloyd & Peirce 2003). Slashing or mowing populations during the winter can be effective over time, as long as seedlings and regrowth is slashed again or treated with herbicides before flowering occurs (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nGlyphosate and triclopyr are recommended herbicides for the control of Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush in Western Australia (Lloyd & Peirce 2003). However, check with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for control of Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",
    "origin": "Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush is native to southern and eastern Africa (from South Africa to Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritrea) and the Arabian Peninsula (Oman, Yemen and the southern parts of Saudi Arabia). There are several subspecies, and the one that is thought to be widely naturalised in Australia and in other parts of the world has a more limited distribution in southern Africa (in southern Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Lesotho, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana) (Goyder & Nicholas 2001).",
    "growthForm": "Shrub",
    "similarSpecies": "Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush is very similar to Balloon Cotton Bush (Gomphocarpus physocarpus). These two species often grow together and readily hybridise, eventually producing hybrid swarms. These hybrid swarms consist of plants that gradually intergrade between to two species, sometimes making it impossible to assign individual plants to a particular species (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nHowever, typical Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush plants have narrowly egg-shaped and slightly curved fruit that gradually taper to a short pointed projection. On the other hand, Balloon Cotton Bush fruit are almost round in shape and come to an abrupt point, often with a sunken tip (Navie & Adkins 2007).",

It is known to colonise bare soil after attempted control of the Weed of National Significance, Bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), and has been recorded with up to 70 stems per square metre (NSW Agriculture 2005). It has been suggested that some deaths of native birds and animals have been caused by ingestion of the seeds (Maroochy Shire Council undated).\n\nHuman impacts: The plant contains colchicine alkaloids and has been recorded as a cause of poisoning in humans. The rootstock is believed to be more toxic than other parts of the plant. In parts of India it is used under strict preparation guidelines in Ayurvedic medicine, and it is grown commercially for colchicine production.

Some species of Peruvian Lily (Alstroemeria spp.) may also superficially resemble Glory Lily in flower colour and general habit (although not climbing), but the ovary in Peruvian Lily is inferior (sits below the flower) and strongly ribbed, the 'petals' are not all the same (whereas they are in Glory Lily) and the leaves lack tendrils (Spencer 2005).",

The plant can form dense thickets, particularly along waterways, preventing stock access to water (Land Protection 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: Honey Locust is an invasive tree capable of out-competing and replacing native vegetation. It can often create dense monocultures and hence provide restricted habitat for native fauna. The sharp barbs on its branches can also injure wildlife. These monocultures can also provide a haven for introduced pest animals such as foxes, cats and rabbits (Land Protection 2006).\n\nHuman impacts: The plant's long, strong spines can inflict serious injuries and infections to humans and livestock. They can also cause damage to vehicle tyres, restricting vehicle movement near infestations. Even when the plant has died, spines can continue to inflict injury (Land Protection 2006).",
    "controlMethods": "A combination of different control methods is likely to be the most efficient approach.\n\nChemical control: Physical control methods can be effective but will usually need to be followed up with chemical control.\n\nNon-chemical control: Land management: Continual grazing suppresses seedlings but can also assist in spreading seeds into new areas. Grazing can be a useful follow-up control method after herbicide treatment to control seedlings and regrowth, providing the plants do not bear seed pods. For the control of dense infestations on grazing land, burning followed by spot spraying is an economical control method (Land Protection 2006).\n\nMechanical control: Bulldozers can be used to break a plant at or above ground level. Once broken, Honey Locust will vigorously produce regrowth from broken bases and roots. Follow-up with some other form of control such as cultivation or herbicide is necessary (Land Protection 2006). On arable land, dozing following by deep ploughing can control dense infestations, only if followed by regular cropping and/or spot spraying of regrowth. If cultivation is abandoned, reseeding from nearby trees can be a problem (Land Protection 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.",

It has been recorded from degraded roadsides, railway embankments, waste places, and as an environmental weed in native woodlands and tall open forest (Webb et al. 1988; McClintock 1993; eFlora SA 2001; Coveny 2007, pers. comm.; National Herbarium of Victoria 2007; Stajsic 2007, pers. comm.;).",

    "impact": "Native ecosystems: A number of Genista species are highly invasive. They can invade a variety of native ecosystems such as grasslands, woodlands, heathlands, forests, riparian areas and near coastal vegetation, such as on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria, as well as disturbed and degraded areas generally and roadsides (Muyt 2001; Stajsic 2007, pers. comm.). Being legumes, Genista species fix nitrogen, and may have the potential to increase soil fertility, encouraging other weeds to invade. Dense infestations of the related species Cape Broom and Flax-leaf Broom shade out native ground-flora and smaller shrubs, and eventually come to dominate the shrub layer (Muyt 2001).\n\nAgriculture: There are currently no reports of Madeira Broom impacting agriculture in Australia. (Stajsic 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "controlMethods": "There is relatively little information about the control of Madeira Broom.\n\nGiven that Genista is related to the genus Cytisus, the control methods applied for English Broom (Cytisus scoparius) and White Spanish Broom (C. multflorus) can be used to control or eradicate Madeira Broom (Muyt 2001).\n\nBecause of the longevity of the soil-stored seeds of Genista species, which can remain dormant for at least ten years eliminating larger incursions has to be considered a long-term endeavour (Muyt 2001).\n\nNon-chemical control: Seeds of Genista species usually fail to establish in dense shade. As such creating any soil disturbance will normally induce the mass germination of soil stored seeds, which may continue to germinate for a number of years. In established infestations of Genista, seed numbers can reach several thousand per square metre (Muyt 2001).\n\nMechanical control: Bulldozing and then burning has been used for larger infestations of English Broom Cytisus scoparius (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). However, to date there are no extensive populations of Madeira Broom requiring this approach. The advantages of bulldozing and burning are that the adult plants are killed, and the seeds are stimulated to germinate, thus quickening the process of waiting for seeds to germinate so they can be destroyed (Cochrane 2001).\n\nManual control: Hand weeding or hoeing is an option for where there are only isolated plants.\n\nChemical control: Follow-up chemical management, such as spraying the seedlings with herbicide is necessary and may need to be done for many years (CRC 2003). In smaller incursions the cut and paint method can be applied (Muyt 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nMadeira Broom has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process.

    "similarSpecies": "The complex horticultural history and breeding that has occurred in this group make identification very difficult.\n\nThere is confusion with G. x spachiana (a garden hybrid, probably between G. canariensis and G. stenopetala). There also appear to be intermediates or hybrids between Cape Broom (G. monspessulana) and Madeira Broom (Spencer 2002; Stajsic 2007, pers comm.). G. x spachiana is barely distinguishable from Madeira Broom and some consider them to be the same taxon (GRIN 2007; Hosking 2007, pers.comm.). Both were listed in Ross & Walsh (2003) to raise awareness among collectors that there is more than one entity, in the hope that additional specimens will be lodged at herbaria and may aid in resolving some of the confusion (Stajsic 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nCape Broom (Genista monspessulana) differs from Madeira Broom in having fewer flowers (3 to 9) per cluster and the flowering axis shorter than 10 mm. Madeira Broom has a longer flowering axis (10 to 130 mm long) and 10 to 40 flowers per cluster (Webb et al. 1988; Stajsic 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nFlax-leaf Broom (G. linifolia) differs from Madeira Broom in having almost stalkless or very shortly stalked leaves and leaflets which are narrow and more or less straight-sided. This contrasts with the stalked leaves of Madeira Broom which are oval or reversely egg-shaped (Webb et al. 1988; Jeanes 1996).\n\nA small infestation of Genista depressa [as Genista tinctoria subsp. depressa] has been recorded at Buckleys Falls, near Geelong, although it apparently has been eliminated (National Herbarium of Victoria 2007). It differs from Madeira Broom in having leaves consisting of a single leaflet (Jeanes 1996).",

    "habitat": "Cape Broom (Genista monspessulana) favours scrub and open woodland in its area of origin (Tutin et al. 1968). In Australia it occurs mainly in higher rainfall  of southern Australia, south-west corner of Western Australia and the south-eastern states, and readily invades disturbed areas such as native vegetation, roadsides, fencelines, creek margins and poorly managed pastures. It also colonises disturbed bushland vegetation especially grassland, woodland and open forest (Jeanes 1996; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; National Herbarium of Victoria 2007).\n\nMontpellier broom can inhabit a broader range of habitats than Scotch broom because it tolerates warmer and drier Mediterranean climates 0t has also been found in wetlands 0n many areas of Australia Montpellier broom is found growing together with Scotch broom (Office of Environment and Heritage 2014).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Cape Broom (Genista monspessulana) is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in temperate Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. Approximately 600,000 ha or more of national, state and urban parks, and fallow land are already infested with Cape Broom (Sheppard & Henry 2012). Cape Broom grows quickly, produces large amounts of long-lived seed, and can tolerate diverse environmental conditions. Being a leguminous shrub, it fixes nitrogen and consequently increases soil fertility providing a favourable habitat for re-generation and germination of more Cape Broom and other introduced weeds. Cape Broom establishes a large long-lived seed-bank making it difficult to eradicate (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Muyt 2001; Department of Primary Industries Victoria 2004).\n\nAgriculture: Cape Broom forms dense thickets which exclude most other vegetation. Dense infestations in pastures reduce carrying capacity of grazing land, provide harbour for rabbits and foxes. Cape Broom is considered toxic to stock if grazed excessively, but in Australia no cases of poisoning have been reported. Forestry impacts – Cape Broom is a weeds of major concern to foresters as they grow quickly and out-compete native and plantation species (Office of Environment and Heritage 2014).\n\nNative ecosystems:  Cape Broom forms dense thickets which exclude most other vegetation increasing fire fuel-loads, changing vegetation structure. It out-competes indigenous plants and discourages their regeneration by shading under-storey species and by using nitrogen fixation to increase soil fertility, increasing soil erosion by excluding grasses and ground-covers thereby increasing the amount of bare ground underneath (Office of Environment and Heritage 2014). Fires and soil disturbance in infested areas usually lead to mass germination of soil-stored seed. In some areas of remnant bushland Cape Broom is sufficiently established to be assumed to be an indigenous plant and is retained in the belief it is part of the natural environment.\n\nUrban areas: Readily invades disturbed areas such as roadsides, fence-lines, and abandoned or uncared for land. The infestation of abandoned grazing paddocks on the peri-urban fringe by Cape Broom thickets is also a fire hazard that increases the risk of bushfires moving into residential suburbs.",
    "controlMethods": "Control of Cape Broom (Genista monspessulana) is possible by chemical, mechanical, and biological means. However, when mature flowering plants are removed, many seedlings will germinate from the soil seed bank and  long term follow-up is critical. Integrated control methods (combining control techniques over time), with long term follow-up is advised for control success. Preventing spread in new areas is the best form of control and weed hygiene should always be employed. A long-term strategic program is required to effectively control Cape Broom concentrating on exhausting the large, long-lived seed-bank and preventing further additions to it. New infestations should be treated prior to plants reaching the flowering stage. Once plants start to produce seeds control becomes more difficult and dispersal to other areas is likely. Treated areas should be regularly checked for regeneration, particularly after fire and soil disturbance.\n\nChemical control: Larger plants can be cut and painted with a suitable herbicide. Smaller plants can be slashed to control their regeneration and any regrowth sprayed with a suitable herbicide. Various herbicide are effective and available for use, please see, Office of Environment and Heritage (2014)  and DPI NSW (2019) for further details. Herbicide application methods are:\n\nFoliar spraying: For the application of herbicide solution to weed foliage in the form of a spray, a common method used for woody plants. Foliar spraying can be used to treat plants of all ages but can be less effective on older plants.\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface killing the plant to prevent regeneration from the rootstock.\n\nBasal barking: This method involves applying herbicide mixed with an adjuant to the lower trunk or stem of woody plants up to around 50 mm in diameter to a height of 30-40 cm above ground level.\n\nStem injection (drill-and-fill): Stem injection delivers herbicide directly to the sapwood but is rarely used on brooms, but when used, it is for plants with stems over 50 mm in circumference.\n\nScrape-and-paint: This method involves scraping away a small section of the bark and applying herbicide directly onto the sapwood. It is an effective but rarely used technique normally used on larger plants.\n\nSplatter or gas gun:  splatter guns were developed over thirty five years ago for sheep drenching and has been adapted for weed spraying using chemicals.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Control methods are described in detail in Office of Environment and Heritage (2014).\n\nPhysical control:  Seedlings and smaller plants can be dug out with small tools, or pulled out by hand, preferably when the ground is moist and soft. This is normally used in new infestations that have not flowered or in area after mature plants have been removed, and this type follow-up removes the many new seedlings that would have subsequently germinated. Older senescent broom plants can be cut at or below ground level, sometimes without the subsequent use of herbicide as they usually do not re-sprout or coppice at that stage of their life cycle.\n\nMechanical control: Removal by clearing is a useful method of controlling large infestations of Cape Broom. Crushing, mechanical pulling plants, or slashing with machinery clears areas ready for follow-up control methods required when mass of germination of Cape Broom seedlings will occurs from the soil seed-bank.\n\nMulching: Mulching or grooming with a tractor or excavator-mounted mulcher cuts bushes off at ground level and processes them to fine mulch. The mulch provides some suppression of seedling growth leaving a cleaner site after control than some other mechanical methods.\n\nCultivation: Cultivation with disc or mouldboard ploughs is useful for breaking established roots and for follow-up treatment of seedlings and regrowth in large infestations.\n\nCompetition and management: Stock availability, adequate fencing and the establishment of strong pasture grasses are the keys to using grazing to improve broom management.\n\nFire:  Most adult plants are killed by fire, but some are capable of re-sprouting from the rootstock. Although the amount of soil-stored seed may be reduced by burning, effective control of Cape Broom can only be achieved by regular treatment of regenerating seedlings by hand-pulling or herbicide application for 3 to 5 years following fire (Muyt 2001; Department of Primary Industries Victoria 2004, Australian Weeds Committee 2011). Soil-stored seed is stimulated to germinate following fire and may continue to germinate for many years following burning.\n\nBiological control: Cape Broom has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. A number of biological agents have been identified (Department of Primary Industries Victoria 2004; Sheppard & Henry 2012). Two insects, the Cape Broom psyllid; Arytinnis hakani, and the weevil; Lepidapion nr argentatum, both give good control.",

The young stems are deep green, five-sided or angled. Plants also have longer pods (fruits) to 70 mm long.\n\nGenista linifolia (Flax-leaf Broom) is similar to Cape Broom but with a more sprawling habit and distinctively thin, lance-shaped leaflets that are dark green above and covered in silvery hairs underneath; the hairy seed pods are in clusters at branch tips are distinct. Plants can have a ‘silvery’ appearance from a distance.\n\nCape Broom may not always be readily distinguished from Genista stenopetala and Genista xspachiana. There are taxonomic difficulties in this group and hybridization between species occurs. These two species greater numbers of flowers in clusters than Cape Broom, and generally slightly larger leaflets. However, these features can grade into Cape Broom (Genista monspessulana).\n\nGorse (Ulex europaeus) is a very spiny shrub, of similar size, also with yellow pea-like flowers.",

    "habitat": "In the Mediterranean region where it is native, Flax-leaf Broom grows in woodland and scrub, and has a preference for acidic soils (Tutin et al. 1968). Like Montpellier broom flax-leaf Broom can inhabit a broader range of habitats than Scotch broom because it tolerates warmer and drier Mediterranean climates (Office of Environment and Heritage 2014)\n\nIt invades a variety of different native ecosystems, such as woodlands and open areas including dunes and coastal areas, usually favouring disturbed sites, such as roadsides, and railway embankments, in regions with a warm temperate climate, moderate rainfall, and slightly acidic soil (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Csurhes & Edwards 1998). It tolerates both relatively dry and wetter sites (Stajsic 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Flax-leaf Broom (Genista linifolia) is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS), is regarded as an environmental weed, and is seen as posing a very high threat to numerous native vegetation communities as well as being a problem for agriculture (Carr et al. 1992; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Csurhes & Edwards 1998).\n\nAgriculture: Flax-leaf Broom is believed to be toxic but is rarely grazed and as such isn’t perceived as being a problem. However, it can from dense clumps which reduce grazing area (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems:  The dense clumps and hedge rows formed by Flax-leaf Broom exclude native vegetation and can provide habitat for feral animals (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Csurhes & Edwards 1998). It out-competes native plants by using nitrogen fixation to increase soil fertility. Furthermore, Flax-leaf Broom is also considered a serious fire hazard (Office of Environment and Heritage 2014) and is able to recover quickly after disturbances such as fire (Australian Weeds Committee 2011).  It is a weed of disturbed areas such as roadsides but it also invade a range of woodland and forest types, damp sclerophyll forest, grassy woodland, lowland grassland, coastal shrubland, and riparian vegetation, (Carr et al. 1992). Flax-leaf Broom readily colonises coastal areas and in southern Australia it invades sand dunes (Office of Environment and Heritage 2014).\n\nUrban areas:  Readily invades disturbed areas such as roadsides, rail embankments, fence-lines, and abandoned grazing paddocks or uncared for land.",
    "controlMethods": "Given that Flax-leaf Broom (Genista linifolia) is possible by chemical, mechanical, and biological means.  As flax-leaf Broom is closely related to the genus Cytisus, the control methods applied for Cytisus scoparius, C. multiflorus, and Cape Broom (Genista monspessulana) can be used to control or eradicate Genista linifolia (Muyt 2001).\n\nIt is very important to control isolated young plants should be controlled before they set seed to prevent the establishment of a soil seed bank (Australian Weeds Committee 2011). Because of the longevity of the soil-stored seeds of Flax-leaf Broom and other Genista species, which can remain dormant for at ten years (or more), eliminating larger infestations should be approached as a long-term endeavour (Muyt 2001).\n\nSeeds of Genista species usually fail to establish in dense shade. As such creating any soil disturbance will normally induce a mass germination of soil stored seeds, which may continue to germinate for a number of years. In established infestations of Genista, seed numbers can reach several thousand per square metre (Muyt 2001).\n\nChemical control: Various herbicide are effective and available for use, please see, Office of Environment and Heritage (2014)  and DPI NSW (2019) for further details. Herbicide application methods are:\n\nFoliar spraying: Foliar herbicide spraying is the application of herbicide solution to weed foliage in the form of a spray, a common method used for woody plants. Foliar herbicide spray can be applied to control Flax-leaf Broom, but follow-up treatments of re-growth of mature plants are necessary. Smaller plants can be slashed to control their regeneration and any regrowth sprayed with a suitable herbicide. Furthermore, damage to native plants should be minimised Australian Weeds Committee 2011).\n\nCut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment): is when each stem is cut off at ground level and immediately applying herbicide to the cut surface killing the plant to prevent regeneration from the rootstock.\n\nBasal barking: Herbicide can be applied to the bark of smaller stems. This method involves applying herbicide mixed with an adjuant to the lower trunk or stem of woody plants up to around 50 mm in diameter to a height of 30-40 cm above ground level.\n\nStem injection (drill-and-fill): Herbicide can be injected into the bark of larger stems (Australian Weeds Committee 2011). Stem injection delivers herbicide directly to the sapwood but is rarely used on brooms, but when used, it is for plants with stems over 50 mm in circumference.\n\nScrape-and-paint: This method involves scraping away a small section of the bark and applying herbicide directly onto the sapwood. It is an effective but rarely used technique normally used on larger plants.\n\nSplatter or gas gun:  splatter guns were developed over thirty five years ago for sheep drenching and has been adapted for weed spraying using chemicals.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Control methods are described in detail in Office of Environment and Heritage (2014). Non-chemical methods are usually followed up with chemical (herbicide) applications.\n\nPhysical control:  Seedlings and smaller plants can be dug out with small tools, or pulled out by hand, preferably when the ground is moist and soft. Hand weeding or hoeing is an option for where there are only isolated plants. This is normally used in new infestations that have not flowered or in area after mature plants have been removed, and this type follow-up removes the many new seedlings that would have subsequently germinated. Older senescent broom plants can be cut at or below ground level, sometimes without the subsequent use of herbicide as they usually do not re-sprout or coppice at that stage of their life cycle.\n\nMechanical control: Bulldozing and then burning has been used for larger infestations of Cytisus scoparius (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Removal by clearing is a useful method of controlling large infestations of Cape Broom. Crushing, mechanical pulling plants, or slashing with machinery clears areas ready for follow-up control methods required when mass of germination of Cape Broom seedlings will occurs from the soil seed-bank.\n\nMulching: Mulching or grooming with a tractor or excavator-mounted mulcher cuts bushes off at ground level and processes them to fine mulch. The mulch provides some suppression of seedling growth leaving a cleaner site after control than some other mechanical methods.\n\nCultivation: Cultivation with disc or mouldboard ploughs is useful for breaking established roots and for follow-up treatment of seedlings and regrowth in large infestations.\n\nCompetition and management: Stock availability, adequate fencing and the establishment of strong pasture grasses are the keys to using grazing to improve broom management.\n\nFire:  Most adult plants are killed by fire, but some are capable of re-sprouting from the rootstock. Although the amount of soil-stored seed may be reduced by burning, effective control can only be achieved by regular treatment of regenerating seedlings by hand-pulling or herbicide application for 3 to 5 years following fire (Muyt 2001; Department of Primary Industries Victoria 2004, Australian Weeds Committee 2011). Soil-stored seed is stimulated to germinate following fire and may continue to germinate for many years following burning.\n\nBiological control:  Flax-leaf Broom has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. However, no biological control program has yet been initiated (Australian Weeds Committee 2011).\n\nFor more detailed information on control refer to Parsons & Cuthbertson (1992), Cochrane (2001) and Muyt (2001), Office of Environment and Heritage (2014) and DPI NSW (2019).",
    "origin": "Flax-leaf Broom (Genista linifolia) is native to the western Mediterranean region of Europe (Tutin et al. 1968), including France (south and Corsica), Spain (including Baleares and Canary Islands), as well as in Algeria and Morocco (GRIN 2007).",

    "similarSpecies": "Flax-leaf Broom (Genista linifolia) is generally similar to other shrubs that have yellow pea flowers and leaves divided into three leaflets. These include some native plants could be mistaken for Broom species including;  Goodia species example; Goodia lotifolia, indigenous to the east coast of Australia (Muyt 2001); Bossiaea foliosa; Exocarpus species, for example Exocarpus strictus; Jacksonia scoparia; Pultenaea daphnoides (large-leaf bitter-pea); and Viminaria juncea (native broom or swiftbush).\n\nOther weedy species that could be mistaken for Cape Broom including the introduced Genista and Cytisus species.\n\nFlax-leaf Broom (Genista linifolia) differs from both Cape Broom (Genista monspessulana) and Madeira Broom (Genista stenopetala) in having almost stalkless or very shortly stalked leaves (note that the individual leaflets are shortly stalked), which are linear or narrowly elliptic linear-oblanceolate. The leaflets on Cape Broom are egg-shaped, and those on Madeira Broom are elliptic or egg-shaped (Webb et al. 1988; Jeanes 1996; Stajsic 2007, pers. comm.). Flax-leaf Broom has its flowers arranged in short dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Those of Cape Broom are borne singly or are arranged in small clusters on short branches along the stems.\n\nDyers Broom (Genista tinctoria) differs in having leaves with a single leaflet only (Jeanes 1996).\n\nThe flowers of Madeira Broom are arranged in elongated clusters at the ends of the branches (Navie 2004).\n\nEnglish Broom (Cytisus scoparius) is an erect shrub of a similar size, with larger yellow pea-like flowers and smooth, (without hairs on the) stems and leaves. The young stems are deep green, five-sided or angled. Plants also have longer pods (fruits) to 70 mm long.\n\nGorse (Ulex europaeus) is a very spiny shrub, of similar size, also with yellow pea-like flowers.",

    "similarSpecies": "False Cleavers is similar to a number of other Galium species, as well as several other genera in the family Rubiaceae.\n\nCleavers (Galium aparine), False Cleavers (Galium spurium) and Rough Corn Bedstraw (G. tricornutum) are easily confused, and all three species are characterised by the possession of robust backward-pointing hairs on stems and leaf margins.\n\nFalse Cleavers (Galium spurium ) can be distinguished from Cleavers (Galium aparine), by its yellow or yellow-green (rather than white) flowers. The flower lobes are shorter, also with an absence of a ring of fine hairs around the stems in False cleavers (Toelken 1986; Stace 1997; Thompson 2008 in prep.). The leaves in False Cleavers are mostly in rings of four to five, compared with rings of six to eight in Cleavers.\n\nCorn Bedstraw (Galium tricornutum) lacks hairs. The fruits of Rough Corn Bedstraw are slightly roughened by small granules, not smooth, and never have hooked hairs (Thompson 2008 in prep.).\n\nThe other introduced species of Galium are much smaller and/or finer than Cleavers and have different fruit. Of the eight alien species of Galium naturalised in Australia, all except G. palustre have a distinct see-through pointed leaf tip, a character not evident in the native species.\n\nSome native Galium species have hairy fruits, but all have leaves arranged in a ring of four.\n\nThe related genus Asperula includes two native species, Asperula conferta and Asperula euryphylla, with leaves in rings of six or more, and with short hooked hairs on the stems, but the fruits of both these species are smooth (James & Allen 1992; Jeanes 1999).\n\nField Madder (Sherardia arvensis) is another member of the family Rubiaceae that may be confused with False Cleavers. It has stalkless, lilac to white flowers borne in tight clusters (Navie 2004).",

It is drought and salt tolerant, a weed of highly disturbed sites (e.g. mine sites), waste areas, coastal environments, roadsides, parks, footpaths and lawns (Queensland Government 2016).\n\nAgriculture: Bees that collect the nectar of Galenia produce honey with such a disagreeable flavour that is unsaleable. Galenia  invades pastures and disturbed areas, and is known to produce nitrates that can be toxic to stock. (DPI NSW 2019), but is generally found in areas where over-grazing has occurred (Queensland Government 2016). However, although the research shows that Galenia contains levels of nitrates and soluble oxalates that can be toxic to stock, on infertile soils these chemical were not found to be in high levels, but plants grown in fertile soils accumulated the chemicals in toxic amounts (Williams 1979).\n\nNative ecosystems: It aggressively invades coastal dunes, disturbed open vegetation, roadside vegetation, and rocky outcrop vegetation.  In Victoria, Galenia is recorded as invading dry coastal vegetation, low grasslands, grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and rock outcrop vegetation (Carr et al. 1992). Rocky chenopod open-scrub is reported as being invaded by Galenia. In South Australia at the Bolivar Treatment Works this species forms a dominant understorey mat in degraded woodland sites to the exclusion of other native ground flora. It is recorded as preventing the regeneration of seedlings in an endangered population of River Red Gum in the Hunter Catchment.\n\nUrban areas: Invades any disturbed areas like roadsides, parks, footpaths and lawns.",
    "controlMethods": "Galenia (Galenia pubescens) is a difficult weed to control once established. An integrated approach (numerous control methods) is required. Mahmood et al.  (2018) confirms that the use of one control option is insufficient to control Galenia.\n\nChemical control: Galenia can be controlled with the use of a registered herbicide applied using a foliar spray when plants are actively growing during winter, spring and summer on fresh new growth. Optimal control is achieved for immature plants or before flowering. The use of herbicide alone will require follow up checks and retreatment. Replanting bare areas will help prevent Galenia re-establishment and reduce the number of follow up treatments. For herbicides recommended for NSW please see DPI NSW (2019). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for further chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: is an effective management option. However, be sure to remove the large taproot, otherwise plants will regrow.  Removing large infestations can potentially leave significant areas of bare ground. Consider re vegetating these areas following control.\n\nHand pulling: Small infestations and individual plants may be removed by hand pulling or digging out.\nMechanical control: Galenia can be mechanically removed by ploughing, chipping or grubbing. All the root material must be removed to prevent resprouting. Once the weed is removed bare ground is often exposed and a vegetation replacement program should be used to prevent re-invasion by other weeds.\nCompetition and management: Not normally a problem in well maintained pastures, but replanted areas cleared will help prevent re-establishment.\nCultural methods: Goats have been used to control weed species and Galenia is listed as a species moderately palatable to them. However the impact of goats on native species occurring with Galenia should be considered if this method is contemplated.\nBiological control: There are currently no biological control agents available for this species.",

In its native range in the United States Snakecotton inhabits disturbed sandy soils and is restricted in the south to sand prairie or sand hill regions and sandy coastal areas (McCauley & Ungar 2002).

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Snakecotton is one of seventeen sleeper weeds identified by the Bureau of Rural Sciences (following consultation with the Australian Weeds Committee) which could have nationally significant impacts on agriculture if allowed to spread.\n\nThe ability of Snakecotton to produce seed quickly, allied with an absence of any form of dormancy, other than temperature dependence, can result in rapid colonisation of affected areas. Plants are unpalatable and have no feed value, but are eaten when little other feed is available (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nAgriculture: Snakecotton has been identified as having a potential financial risk impact on all forms of grazing land use (Cunningham et al. 2003). Climate analyses and comparison of overseas occurrence indicate Snakecotton is more likely to establish in drier parts of central Queensland and northern New South Wales. Dryland grazing and cropping landuses are most at risk from spread of this species into its potential climate range (FAO 2006; Cunningham & Brown 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: Little information is currently available on the potential environmental impacts or impacts on biodiversity of snake cotton. It is known to be naturalised and a problem warranting control in natural ecosystems in at least four locations in Queensland (Groves et al. 2003).",

Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Single or small groups of plants are best removed by digging or pulling when the soil is moist, before any seed are set. Care should be taken to remove all root material as Snakecotton can regenerate from root fragments left in the ground (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Management control: Occurrence modelling suggests that Snakecotton will be restricted to open, disturbed habitats (sandy soils only), such as roadsides, stockyards and any pastures that have been grazed bare during drought (Qld DAF 2016). As such, while these species could affect a substantial area, they are likely to be symptomatic of overgrazing. Wise pasture management could prevent these species from having major impacts",
    "origin": "Snakecotton is a native of the United States of America, from the southern and central plains through portions of the Midwest and southeast, particularly western and central Florida. It is most common in the southern United States (McCauley & Ungar 2002; GRIN 2007). Examination of collections from the United States indicates the range of Snakecotton has expanded substantially since 1900. This is most likely due to both natural exploitation of open habitats and unintentional human introductions (McCauley & Ballard 2002). It has been classified as a weed in Nebraska and the Great Plains (Stubbendieck et al. 1994). Snakecotton is also recorded as occurring in the West Indies (USDA 2007).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "A similar species to Snakecotton, known as Cottonweed or Slender Snakecotton (Froelichia gracilis), also native to North America, is occasionally naturalised in the Central Coast region of New South Wales. Slender Snakecotton differs from Snakecotton in that it is a small, erect to ascending herb to 25 cm high, with narrower leaves and shorter flowering spikes (Jacobs & Lapinpuro 2000).",

    "habitat": "Fennel grows in temperate regions with a moderate rainfall on a wide range of soil types. It prefers open situations such as along railway lines or roadsides, channels and drains, and neglected areas (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Fennel invades dry coastal vegetation, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, riparian vegetation and rock outcrop vegetation (Carr et al. 1992). IT has even been found in dry arid situations (eFlora 2021), but is rarely found in dry arid environments (AVH 2021).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) impacts cool to warm temperate, and humid areas, growing in native vegetation and agricultural areas. It also is a weed of roadsides, railways, stream banks, alluvial flats, irrigation channels, gardens, refuse sites and disturbed areas, particularly in suburban areas. Strongly smelling of aniseed, some people consider the plant to have an offensive or even nauseating smell. Fennel is able to successfully compete with other vegetation once it is established, and may form dense stand excluding all other vegetation.\n\nAgriculture: Commonly occurs in agricultural areas. Although not always considered palatable by animals, sheep and cattle may graze young plants, fennel can invade agricultural areas, particularly degraded pastures, with Queensland Government (2016) documenting it as palatable to livestock and is generally not seen as a major problem in these areas. However, Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001) comment toxicity problems in grazing animals are generally not encountered but deaths of both sheep and cattle have previously occurred after eating residues from distillation of commercially grown fennel plants. The grazing of Fennel stubbles do not appear to be toxic and it is rarely if ever a problem in field situations.\n\nNative ecosystems: Impacts on vegetation found along road, rail and water ways potentially preventing native plant species from establishing or shading out existing plants. This could be of great significance in farming areas when remnant vegetation is often restricted to road and rail verges. Found in open woodland  especially along tracks and paths and the edges, and in open areas especially grasslands.\n\nUrban areas: A weed of urban areas, colonises gardens, abandoned and little carried for sites. Dense infestations along waterways may restrict some recreational activities (Muyt 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is easily controlled when young before the plant elongate and grow a tall flowering stem. Treatment should occur when the plants are young , when they can be easily removed or are susceptible to herbicides. Mature plants are persistent and difficult to eradicate (Western Australian Herbarium 1998-).\n\nChemical control: Spot spraying should be carried out on actively growing young plants before they elongate and reach flowering stage, preferably with a selective woody weed herbicide. If the plants are growing near sensitive vegetation, they can be treated by the cut and paint method in winter-spring before new growth emerges. Make the cut close to the base or plants will re-sprout. Dense infestations can be slashed or burnt in winter to provide access for spraying in spring. Wild Fennel may sometimes be harvested by people for culinary use, so if spraying in public places, use a dye in the spray, and place a sign indicating that the plants have been sprayed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Follow up control of seedlings is required. Combination of burning followed by spraying may be effective for mature plants.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Removing individuals of small plants or infestations of fennel is recommended with young plants hand chipped. To avoid cultivated forms of fennel becoming weed escapees remove spent flower heads before seed set. Fennel roots and foliage should be disposed of in hot composts to avoid unintentional vegetative or seed propagation (McFarlane 2007).  However, care should be taken if digging out mature large plants as Fennel is deep rooted, it can regrow from pieces left after cultivation.\n\nMechanical control: Slashing just before flowering may kill the plants, or repeat slashing of regrowth may be needed. At worst, slashing stems at flowering time will prevent seed set and buy a little time before the whole plant needs to be treated. .\n\nCompetition and management: Does not normally occur in healthy well managed pastures. Fennel does not appear to establish well on grazed or regularly cultivated paddocks (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Most controlled in crops with general weed management activities. \nSee Tamar Valley Weed Strategy Working Group (2015) for further information.",

    "similarSpecies": "Wild Carrot (Daucus carota) which is common on roadside may be confused with Fennel. It has similar umbrella shaped heads of white or pinkish flowers, but the crushed leaves smell carroty and not of aniseed.\n\nHemlock (Conium maculatum) is another weed in the same family which is poisonous to humans and livestock. It differs from Fennel by having white flowers and the stems are hollow. It does have a strong odour, but it is not of aniseed (Cunningham et al. 1992; Walsh & Entwisle 1999).\n\nAniseed plant (Pimpinella anisum) has a similar aroma and is in the same family.",

In Australia it grows in similarly disturbed sites, often in moist situations (Ainsworth & Weiss 2002; Gillespie & Faithfull 2004).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Japanese Knotweed is considered a notoriously invasive plant in Britain, having spread extensively since its introduction into gardens there in the 1850s, where it has formed dense monospecific (single species) stands. Japanese Knotweed forms monospecific stands on riverbanks and other disturbed sites, and the annual dying back in winter leaves the ground susceptible to erosion. (Anon. 2008; Ainsworth & Weiss 2002; Barney et al. 2006; Doll & Doll 2002; Gillespie & Faithfull 2004; Hollingsworth & Bailey 2000). Japanese knotweed is regarded as a potentially serious environmental weed in Victoria and Tasmania, and as a \"sleeper weed\" in other parts of southern Australia (Weeds of Australia 2016).\n\nJapanese knotweed can cause blockages in waterways, as the dead stems accumulate in rivers and streams channels, increasing the risk of flooding. It can also contribute to the erosion of riverbanks, restrict access to waterways, and interfere with irrigation channels in cropping areas (Weeds of Australia 2016).\n\nUrban environments: The underground stems, and emerging shoots, can cause damage to paving, bitumin roadways and other structures (Weeds of Australia 2016).",
    "controlMethods": "Japanese Knotweed is very hard to eradicate because it has the ability to re-grow from vegetative pieces and from seeds.\n\nNon-chemical control: Single young plants can be pulled by hand when soil is moist and roots are small. Roots and runners must be removed to prevent re-sprouting (Plant Invaders of Mid-Atlantic Natural Areas 2010). Cutting, mowing and grazing can be used to to control new growth.\n\nChemical control: Chemical control measures are being used for the control of Japanese Knotweed in Australia (Ainsworth & Weiss 2002; Gillespie & Faithfull 2004; Hansford 2008 pers.comm; Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water 2007). Herbicides have been used effectively, applied to freshly cut stems or foliage  (Plant Invaders of Mid-Atlantic Natural Areas 2010).\n\nSee the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nBiological control: A biological control agent exists for Japanese Knotweed and was released in the United Kingdom in 2010 (Plant Invaders of Mid-Atlantic Natural Areas 2010).",

    "growthForm": "Shrub",
    "similarSpecies": "Japanese Knotweed looks similar to the related Giant Knotweed, Fallopia sachalinensis, which is a more robust species with larger but relatively narrower leaves with a shortly acute apex, and with greenish to whitish flowers. If grown together, these two species can produce a hybrid, known as Hybrid Knotweed (F. x bohemica), which looks intermediate in its features. They can be told apart by differences in leaf shape and size and whether the undersurface of the leaf is hairy or not. Giant Knotweed has leaves 20-40 cm long, with the base deeply curved or heart-shaped; the margins and veins on the under-surface have scattered elongated multicellular hairs. Both Japanese Knotweed and the hybrid have smaller leaves (3-10 cm long in Japanese Knotweed; 5–30 in the hybrid), with scattered, sparse smaller hairs or no hairs visible on the under-surface (small ridges or lumps in the case of Japanese Knotweed; short hairs in the case of the hybrid) (Wilson 2007). Given the close similarities, identifications should be checked at a herbarium, although any Knotweeds are invasive and populations should be destroyed when found (Ainsworth & Weiss 2002; Bailey 2003; Gillespie & Faithfull 2004; Barney et al. 2006; Wilson 2007).",

The species is commonly associated with coastal sand dunes and sand plains and swamps but also reported from inland areas. In Western Australia it is predominantly in coastal heath and Tuart woodland communities. It is often associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, cleared paddocks and degraded bushland (Weber 1986; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Paczkowska & Chapman 2000; Randall & Brooks 2000).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "False Caper invades grassland and sandy areas including both agricultural production and native ecosystems. It impacts human and animal health, and reduces native biodiversity and feed to stock. A weed of pasture, vegetables, roadsides, gardens, coastal heath, open grassy woodlands and disturbed areas. it is mostly unpalatable to stock and rarely causes problems unless stock have no other feed, but can become dominate and exclude most other species and losses of stock in have been attributed to eating false caper.\n\nNative ecosystems: The rapid growth and prolific seeding gives it the potential to significantly impact of the biodiversity in areas of native vegetation. It is a serious competitor of pasture species and can invade areas of healthy native bushland where it forms dense thickets which out compete native species for habitat resources (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Randall & Brooks 2000).\n\nAgriculture: False Caper exudes a caustic milky sap and is mostly unpalatable to livestock. However, it has been suspected of causing death of livestock due to cyanide poisoning (Weber 1986; James & Harden 1990; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nUrban areas: Can become dominate in urban areas with calcareous, sandy soil. Its milky sap can also cause skin and eye irritation in humans.  Its milky latex-like sap is heavy in alkaloids and can cause irritation and swelling to the human body, particularly sensitive areas such as the eyes.",
    "controlMethods": "False caper is notoriously difficult to control once established. Livestock avoid consuming the plant due to the irritant milky sap; as a result it dominates in poorly managed pastures. However, False Caper does not appear to persist in frequently cultivated soils.\n\nNon-chemical control: Manageable infestations of False Caper can be removed by digging. However, care needs to be taken as the plants exude a toxic milky sap when damaged. For plants older than three weeks of age, care should be taken to remove all the roots as False Caper can regrow from root fragments left in the ground. Heavy mulching of areas cleared of False Caper has been found useful in reducing regeneration of False Caper from seedling recruitment from the soil seed bank (Randall & Brooks 2000). In arable lands, cultivation can be an effective method of control, as it does not persist on frequently cultivated land (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nChemical control: False Caper is susceptible to several herbicides and spraying actively growing plants gives good control. It is advisable to control False caper at seedling stage before flowering, this is the most economical and effective method. The use of broadleaf herbicides will allow competitive grasses to grow and compete with false caper seedlings, this will reduce false caper germination the following year., For further details,see: Parsons & Cuthbertson (1992); Randall & Brooks (2000); Western Australian Herbarium (1998–).\n\nPlease also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for further chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "habitat": "Sea Spurge is a weed of coastal habitats and offshore islands in the temperate regions of Australia. It occurs on free draining sandy soils on beaches, around estuaries, through dune fields, in coastal herbfields, grasslands, heaths and shrublands, and may also grow along rocky shorelines and in sand-filled cracks between rocks. However, it is most commonly found on coastal sand dunes (Blood 2001; Navie & Adkins 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Sea Spurge was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Sea Spurge was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national signficance.\n\nNative ecosystems: Sea Spurge is regarded as a significant environmental weed throughout the coastal districts of southern Australia. It has successfully invaded many open coastal communities, quickly establishing large and dense infestations (Navie and Adkins 2007). Populations of this species may reach tens of thousands where beaches are free of other vegetation or have a low level of plant cover. It can also rapidly colonise eroded areas, such as blowouts (depressions in dunes caused by wind blowing the sand away), often becoming the dominant plant species.\n\nSea Spurge initially colonises the foredunes at the back of the beach. These infestations tend to stabilise the dunes, preventing natural sand movement inland, and creating a different dune structure to that created by native species (Rudman 2003). This can also decrease the availability of beach nesting sites for shore birds, and may be contributing to their decline in some areas. For example, the endangered Hooded Plover (Thinornis rubricollis) uses un-vegetated sand areas on beaches for nesting sites (Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania 2003). If uncontrolled, Sea Spurge can then spread inland from these areas, displacing native vegetation and invading adjacent grassland communities. In New South Wales, Sea Spurge is thought to threaten the survival of endangered native coastal plants, such as Chamaesyce psammogeton (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nHuman impacts: Sea Spurge is poisonous to humans and the milky sap in its stems can be highly irritating when it comes into contact with the skin or when it is accidentally rubbed into the eyes (Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Check with your local council or state/territory weed management agency about its requirements for Sea Spurge control. Killing plants is quite easy but it can be hard to achieve long-term control of sea spurge because seeds can spread to new or previously controlled areas via the ocean. Success is more likely in areas where infestations are new and the chance of re-infestation from local and floating seeds is low (NSW DPI 2019).\n\nNon-chemical control: Small Sea Spurge infestations can be eradicated by physically removing the plants. Smaller plants can be hand-pulled easily, but large plants will need to be dug out. Protective clothing must be worn to protect skin and eyes from the toxic and highly irritative milky sap (Rudman 2003). Sea Spurge seedlings, which can occur in very large numbers, are best left to thin out naturally first and then pulled the following year prior to flowering. Follow-up will also be required to address subsequent seed germination or re-sprouting from broken taproots. Substantial declines in density of Sea Spurge can be achieved by this method, but it may take 4 to 5 years of concerted effort (Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania 2003).\n\nChemical control: Herbicide treatments can also be used, and may be more appropriate where disturbance from hand-pulling is unacceptable or where large infestations are involved (Rudman 2003). Spot spraying is suitable method for larger infestations, and a number of herbicides have been successfully used to control sea spurge, including glyphosate and metsulfuron-methyl.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nBiological control: CSIRO (2021) reported that the foliar blight fungal pathogen Venturia paralias (previously referred to as Passalora euphorbiae),  causes severe disease of sea spurge in its European native range. Preliminary tests showed that this fungus is potentially highly specific and has thus great potential for the biocontrol of sea spurge in Australia. Comprehensive host-specificity testing have been performed in an Australian quarantine facility to assess any risks that the fungus could pose to non-target plant species. Results indicated that the fungus does not pose a threat to non-target species, and thus approval for its release in Australia was sought from the relevant authorities. The biocontrol agent was approved for release in November 2020 and research is underway to develop effective methods for production and field releases.",
    "origin": "Sea Spurge is native to western and southern Europe (Ireland, the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Portugal, Spain, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Romania, Yugoslavia and Ukraine), the Canary Islands, northern Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania and Tunisia) and western Asia (Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Georgia) (Heyligers 2002; GRIN 2007).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Sea Spurge is very similar to several other weedy spurges (Euphorbia spp.), including False Caper (Euphorbia terracina), Caper Spurge (Euphorbia lathyris), Sun Spurge (Euphorbia helioscopia) and Petty Spurge (Euphorbia peplus). But unlike many of these other species, Sea Spurge is usually found growing in sandy coastal sites (particularly on foredunes) and has somewhat fleshy leaves.\n\nIn addition, Caper Spurge, Sun Spurge and Petty Spurge all differ from Sea Spurge in being short-lived species with a single main stem. False Caper, which is the most similar species, differs in having its flowers (cyathia) borne in groups of two or three (Navie &Adkins 2007).",

    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Cockspur Coral Tree invades natural areas such as creek lines, wetlands, hind-dunes, rainforests and salt marshes. In gullies it spreads vigorously and replaces native canopy trees (Pittwater Council undated; Sydney Weeds Committees undated). If left to grow Cockspur Coral Tree will out compete native vegetation, which in turn will reduce the food and habitat of native animals and decrease soil stability and nutrient levels (NSW Weedwise 2018).\n\nHuman impacts: The plant contains alkaloids which have powerful narcotic and purgative effects in humans and the seeds are reported to be poisonous (Plants for a Future 2008).",
    "controlMethods": "Cockspur Coral Tree is very similar to Common Coral Tree (Erythrina x sykessi) and therefore control methods used on Common Coral Tree are likely to be effective on Cockspur Coral Tree.\n\nChemical control: Cockspur Coral Tree is a deciduous tree and herbicide treatment should be applied in the growing season (spring is the best time). Herbicides can be physically injected into the trunk, and after a 24 hour wait, it should then be chopped down, and all pieces removed off site for disposal. If it is too difficult to remove the larger trunks and branches then these should be periodically re-injected with herbicide until the plant stops re-shooting (Riley undated). Herbicide injection requires a lot of poison and can be expensive. It is best to get trees when still young. The method of cutting trees and painting the stumps is unlikely to work as the tree needs to be actively growing to circulate the poison throughout the tree and roots. Any regrowth can be sprayed with herbicide. Care must be taken with herbicide application, particularly if the site is close to a creek. Sprouting logs can be regularly rolled and eventually they will die (Riley undated). See http://wilsonscreeklandcare.mullum.com.au/weeds/coral_tree.html  for more information.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical control: A backhoe can be used to completely remove the plant. This is a good method where there is easy access and where falling branches are a danger (near houses, play areas or roads), but is costly and causes substantial soil disturbance (Riley undated).",

Its scarlet red or reddish-orange flowers that are 30-50 mm long are densely and tightly clustered in short inflorescences and usually appear before the leaves in spring.\n\nBat's Wing Coral Tree (Erythrina vespertilio) has very broad leaflets that are usually two or three-lobed and up to 12 cm wide. Its scarlet red or dark red flowers are up to 30 mm long, are loosely clustered in elongated inflorescences that are 10-30 cm long and appear with the leaves in spring (Navie 2004).",

    "impact": "Spanish Heath was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Spanish Heath was not included as one of the 20 WoNS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. Spanish heath is highly invasive in a variety of habitats including native vegetation, pastures and roadsides.\n\nNative ecosystems: Spanish Heath is a highly invasive plant in higher rainfall districts of south-eastern Australia, and invades various native ecosystems including heathlands, grassy woodlands, moist forest and riparian areas (Carr et al. 1992; Muyt 2001). It is capable of completely dominating the shrub canopy of invaded habitats, preventing virtually all regeneration of native species. It is usually associated with disturbed habitats but can also establish in undisturbed bush (Muyt 2001). It has the potential to actively invade and expand within native vegetation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area and adjacent areas, and in doing so, alter the natural ecology of the area (Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service 2004). It is regarded as a very serious threat to one or more vegetation formations in Victoria (Carr et al. 1992).\n\nAgriculture: It forms dense stands on roadsides and in paddocks, totally excluding other vegetation. Such large infestations increase fuel loads and add to fire hazards.",
    "controlMethods": "Spanish Heath and Ericas in general can be difficult to control as they layer, resprout and produce many seeds, with all these helping the species re-generate after initial control.  Follow up control and integrated control over time is required to manage this weed.\n\nNon-chemical control: Small plants and seedlings can be hand-pulled, ensuring the main roots have been removed. The cut-paint method can be effective and may be enhanced by peeling or cutting away the outer bark on stumps, followed by an application of a suitable herbicide to the exposed areas of sapwood. Preventing seed production can be achieved by slashing plants close to the ground level in autumn/early winter, before the main flush of flowers occurs. Only heavy grazing of seedlings will be effective in controlling Spanish Heath (Mather & Williams 1990). Also see CRC (2007);\n\nChemical control: Regrowth should be sprayed with a suitable herbicide in the following year. Depending upon the site conditions and size and density of the infestations, a combination of techniques may be required. Follow-up control will, in all cases, be necessary for several years. For further information on the control of Spanish Heath, see CRC (2007); DPIPWE Tasmania (2020); Muyt (2001); NSW (2019).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Tree Heath can be differentiated from Spanish Heath by the presence of very small, branched hairs on the younger stems, whereas the hairs on the stems of Spanish Heath are simple (i.e. unbranched). This difference is most easily observed under magnification (Navie 2004; Baker 2007, pers. comm.).",

It infests roadsides, railway lines, waste areas, disturbed sites, footpaths, pastures, grasslands, open woodlands, waterways and coastal sites (Navie & Adkins 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "African Lovegrass was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, African Lovegrass was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: African Lovegrass spreads from roadsides and disturbed sites into neighbouring degraded and poorly managed and overgrazed or poor quality pastures. It is very competitive with other pasture species and quickly overtakes, particularly in sandy soils. It is not normally eaten by livestock when mature, and this increases the competition on more preferable pasture species. African Love grass also has a low nutritional value, thereby decreasing pasture productivity (Navie & Adkins 2007). It can also invade vineyards, horticultural crops and orchards.\n\nNative ecosystems: This species is also regarded as a major environmental weed and currently causes significant problems in Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. During a recent survey it was listed as a priority environmental weed in ten of Australia's Natural Resource Management regions (CRC 2006). African Lovegrass is an early coloniser of disturbed sites, grows rapidly, and can form dense stands which crowd out and replace native species, also preventing their regeneration (Navie & Adkins 2007). In New South Wales it is a particularly serious weed of remnant native grassy vegetation in farming areas, and can transform these threatened communities by modifying their composition, structure and processes. For example, it is seen as a threat to natural temperate grasslands throughout the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. African Lovegrass is also one of a group of exotic perennial grasses that have been listed as being a \"key threatening process\" in New South Wales. In Victoria it has also invaded heathlands, woodlands and grasslands and in south-eastern Queensland it is ranked among the top 50 most invasive plant species (Navie & Adkins 2007). African Lovegrass invasions also pose a threat to the survival of individual threatened species such as the endangered Narrow-petalled Featherflower (Verticordia plumosa var. pleiobotrya) in south-western Western Australia and locally threatened populations of the Pine Donkey Orchid (Diuris tricolor) in the Muswellbrook area in central New South Wales. Because it produces higher fuel loads than native vegetation and is highly flammable, particularly during the dry season, dense infestations can also increase the intensities of bushfires. This has negative impacts for more fire-prone native species and increases the fire hazard to people and property (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nUrban environments:  Grows and invades roadsides and little managed and degraded urban areas.",
    "controlMethods": "For the best results, African Lovegrass requires an integrated control approach as part of overall pasture management. Maintaining a healthy pasture will help to reduce the chances of African Lovegrass infestation, as it quickly establishes in bare areas. Effective control also largely depends on preventing seed spread to clean areas (Land Protection 2006). Check with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for African Lovegrass control.\n\nNon-chemical control: Prevention is the best means of control. To reduce the chance of African Lovegrass establishing you can avoid bringing in hay, grain, or silage from African Lovegrass areas. Also limit animal movement from from infested areas into clean paddocks or quarantine new stock for at least 10 days if moving from infested areas. Maintain good weed hygiene for vehicles and machinery and  before coming onto your property.\n\nEarly detection: controlling any new African Lovegrass infestations as soon as it appears should stop areas becoming infested.\n\nPasture management: Maintain good pastures and weed management practices.  Physical disturbance such as slashing and ploughing are not recommended, as they can promote seed spread and re-infestation. However, physical disturbance followed by immediate replacement dense pastures will prevent African Lovegrass from germinating. If any seedling appear in or on the margins of the pasture and these can be controlled and chipped out or with application of herbicides before they flower. When chipping out the plant, ensure that the entire tussock crown is removed, as this will prevent regrowth (Silcock 2005; Land Protection 2006).\n\nGrazing: African Lovegrass is only palatable to livestock when very young before flowering for a limited time, and quickly forms a tough unpalatable flowering tussock and sets seed. Therefore, heavy grazing of young African Lovegrass is recommended as this is when it is the most palatable and nutritious to livestock, unfortunately at a time when feed is generally available from more palatable species. Grazing can stop African Lovegrass seeding, but should not be the main control strategy (DPI NSW 20219). As cattle can spread viable seed, they should be prevented from grazing on African Lovegrass while it is in seed, or quarantined before moving them into clean paddocks. Re-sowing of desirable pastures species may be the best option in heavily infested areas (Land Protection 2006).\n\nFire: Using fire as a management tool is not usually recommended for African Lovegrass, as it recovers faster than other species and its growth is usually enhanced following burning. However, applying herbicides or heavily grazing the fresh regrowth after a cool fire can help to reduce the large tussocks and encourage the diversification of better pasture species (Silcock 2005; Land Protection 2006).\n\nChemical control: African Lovegrass is difficult to destroy with herbicides but non-selective herbicides can be used on roadsides and spot infestations. Control in pasture depends on management of grazing pressures and appropriate use of herbicide (Government of South Australia 2021). Herbicides can be used as part of integrated management, but foliar application should only be conducted when the plant is green and actively growing. Residual herbicides are best applied from July to December, as this will prevent seed set in the following summer (Land Protection 2006). Spot spraying small or individual plants minimizes soil disturbance.  Herbicides are most effective in combination with healthy, competitive pastures. DPI NSW (2019) state that spraying as a single control method is only effective where African Lovegrass is selectively removed from a strong pasture. Burn heavy infestations before spraying the regrowth. Flupropanate gives the  best control of African Lovegrass. It can take three months to have a noticeable effect and up to 18 months to kill the plant. Avoid spraying in winter. Observe grazing withholding periods. Glyphosate will also kill African Lovegrass. Apply to actively growing plants in spring and summer. Use a glyphosate based herbicide to kill any regrowth.\n\nSee Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018); DPI NSW (2019); the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Some of the most common weedy species, including Stinkgrass (Eragrostis cilianensis), Mexican Lovegrass (Eragrostis mexicana) and Soft Lovegrass (Eragrostis pilosa) can be distinguished by the fact that they are short-lived and smaller in stature.\n\nThe majority of the native species are also short-lived plants that do not develop large tussocks, though some may attain a similar height to African Lovegrass and have a similar weeping habit. In addition, most of the longer-lived tussock-forming native species are much shorter in stature (usually less than 60 cm in height).\n\nAfrican Lovegrass is very similar to Eragostis trichophora, that is also a tufted many stem grass.\n\nHowever, African Lovegrass has long hairs at the very base of the stem where the plant emerges from the soil; the first (lower)  flowering branches are mostly alternate with out hairs where they join the stem.\n\nEragostis trichophora has a smooth base with no hairs at the very base of the stem where the plant emerges from the soil, and and the first flowering branches are in a whorls of 4–6 with long white hairs where the branches join the stem.",

In drier areas the plants greatly reduce the size of their leaves to minimise water loss (CRC 2003). Tolerant to waterlogging, salinity, frost, & fire (rhizomes survive), but it is not drought tolerant.\n\nMost species inhabit swampy areas such as the edges of lakes, rivers and creeks, and prefer disturbed sites. They grow on many types of soil and can tolerate low nutrient levels (CRC 2003). While they prefer wet areas they can move into well-drained soil through vegetative reproduction (Hartzler 2006).\n\nCommon Horsetail (E. arvense) usually grows in damp, open woodlands, pastures, arable lands, roadsides, stream banks and embankments. It will grow in most wet places below altitudes of 300 m. It is a weed in Australia in areas where the annual rainfall is around 1400 mm.\n\nScouring Rush Horsetail (E. hyemale) similarly occurs on moist or springy grasslands, banks and roadsides, and is naturalised in New South Wales in areas below altitudes of 620 m with annual rainfall of 1100-1500 mm (CRC 2003).",

    "impact": "Horsetails are on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 non-native plants that threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage. Although only in the early stages of establishment, Horsetails have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems (CRC 2003). Horsetails are highly invasive, difficult to control and toxic to livestock. They can be allelopathic.\n\nNative ecosystems: Horsetails are known as one of the world's worst weeds and are highly invasive. In Sydney they have infested hundreds of square metres along creek lines. They have the potential to become persistent weeds of wetlands and other low-lying areas. Large areas of natural vegetation are potentially under threat (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: Horsetails are highly toxic to livestock. If consumed in contaminated hay it has been known to kill horses, cattle and sheep (CRC 2003). Most Equisetum species contain poisonous glycosides in the rhizomes and aerial shoots. Equisetum arvense also contains alkaloids that make it toxic to horses, causing a syndrome (equisetosis) that is sometimes fatal.Part of its action may be due to the enzyme thiaminase that destroys thiamine (vitamin B1) in the stomach of the animal.It has also caused losses in sheep and cattle and is reputed to taint milk when eaten in quantity (Government of South Australia 2021). In high densities, Horsetails reduce crop yields by producing inhibitory substances that depress the growth of neighbouring plants (CRC 2003). Equisetum species are also competitive and persistent weeds of crops and pastures in the Northern Hemisphere. Horsetails are of particular concern to the canola, cereals, lupin, apple and pear, and potato growing industries and as a nursery weed (Groves et al. 2005).",
    "controlMethods": "Prevention: Because there are relatively few Horsetail infestations, and they can potentially be eradicated before they become established, any new outbreaks should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Do not try to control Horsetail without their expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nNon-chemical control: Horsetails are extremely difficult to control once established. Their extensive and deep system of rhizomes makes physical removal difficult. They also re-establish easily from root fragments so even leaving small pieces behind in a cleared site will lead to re occurrence of the plants (CRC 2003; Groves et al. 2005).\n\nChemical control: Non-specific herbicides are not effective against Horsetails.

    "impact": "Lesser Jack is a relatively weak competitor but has several strong colonizing characteristics including drought tolerance, rapid growth, abundant seed production, seed dormancy and high dispersal abilities and the two types of achene give the plant its invasive properties. Rapidly produced large subterranean achenes maximise the progeny's fitness/competitiveness whilst numerous (>1000/plant) small spiny aerial achenes maximise the colonizing characteristics of the species. The seeds have the potential to remain viable for many years within the soil enabling the species to persist through long periods of unfavourable conditions (CABI 2021).\n\nAgriculture: Lesser Jack is a weed of pasture and cultivation, and the spiny fruit can cause lameness in stock. Because it grows taller than Spiny Emex, it is more of a problem in cereal crops than that species (Scott et al. 1996; Wilson 2007). The grain industry (cereals, pulses and oilseeds) has restrictions on the maximum allowable levels of contamination with Rumex seed, from 0 (zero) Rumex seed/500 ml in malt barley in South Australia to 20 Rumex seed/500 ml in feed barley or lupins in Western Australia. In wheat, 8 Rumex seed/500 ml is the national maximum standard (Bowran, 1996). Lesser Jack, with its erect growth habit and a seed size similar to grain makes it potentially a far larger problem to the Australian grain-growing industry than the currently widespread Spiny Emex (CABI 2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Lesser Jack has the potential to invade in disturbed areas  as a weed in national parks and nature reserves, and marginal sites such as roads, tracks, firebreaks, picnic areas, old homesteads and clearings. It could also impact on biodiversity and the environment by invading natural areas such as the edges of creeks, riverine flats, alluvial flats (claypans, edges of saline lakes) and rocky areas.\n\nUrban areas: The spiny fruits impact and restrict the use of recreation areas recreational areas, especially where people are bare-footed and spines can penetrate light footwear, and could impact bike riders, puncturing  bicycles tyres (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; VicFora 2016).",

The levels of seed dormancy (more than 4 years in some cases) and longevity make Lesser Jack hard to eradicate\n\nNon-chemical control: Small infestations and isolated plants of Lesser Jack can be grubbed out or manually removed. If the plants are seeding then they should be completely destroyed by burning them.\n\nSmall areas should be fenced off to prevent stock, people and vehicles spreading the seed. For large areas infested with Lesser Jack, shallow cultivate in late summer to encourage germination in autumn and then kill the seedlings with cultivation or herbicides. Deep ploughing is not recommended because it buries seed and induces dormancy, which may be broken when the seeds are returned to the surface in following seasons. Any control program must aim at killing all plants shortly after emergence, and needs to be continued for several years (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). 'Prickle rollers' have been developed to gather and remove surface Lesser Jack fruit from drying greens in vineyards (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: Cultivation kills seedlings, and can be effective when combined with chemical control (Gilbey et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Land Protection 2006). Herbicides are effective but do not eradicate the problem due to seed bank.

    "habitat": "Spiny Emex occurs in sub-humid and semi-arid subtropical and temperate regions. It grows mainly on sandy and loamy soils, and less frequently on clays and in a wide range of vegetation types. It is often found around disturbed areas such as sheep yards, saleyards, roadsides and areas of habitation. It is a widespread weed of grazing and cropping lands but also grows in natural areas especially in drier inland regions, in woodlands, mallee, shrubland, grassland and herb fields, usually in open or disturbed areas such as ephemeral drainage lines, dry creek beds, lake edges, floodplains, riverbanks, salt scalds, bare areas and disturbed sites (Stanley & Ross 1983; Cunningham et al. 1992; Keighery 1996; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Western Australian Herbarium 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Spiny emex (Rumex hypogaeus) is a common weed of agricultural areas, particularly crops, and disturbed habitats (e.g. roadsides, tracks, firebreaks, picnic sites, old homesteads and clearings). However, it is often present in highly disturbed sites in conservation reserves and also invades natural areas including creekbanks, river floodplains, claypans, the edges of saline lakes and granite rock areas. It is a serious weed of crops and pastures.\n\nAgriculture: Spiny Emex is a weed of pasture and cultivation. It can reduce crop yields (particularly cereals) and pasture productivity by competition, as it is fast growing and the prostrate growth smothers more desirable species such as legumes. Infestations of spiny emex can be very dense and counts of more than 900 plants per square metre have been made in Western Australia. South Australian studies show that an infestation of about 11 plants per square metre reduces wheat yields by almost 40% (Agriculture Victoria 2021).  Major impact on quantity of produce It is also a serious weed of dried grapes, as the spiny fruit can become mixed with grapes on drying racks and they are difficult to grade out (Chorney 1986; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty and Associates 2005; Land Protection 2006).  Spiny emex contains oxalates in the leaves which are toxic to ruminants especially sheep (DPI NSW 20219). Stock rarely eat Spiny Emex, but it has been suspected of stock poisoning on some occasions. The plant can contain potentially toxic levels of oxalates at levels that are sufficiently high to poison sheep or cattle if the animals were forced to eat large amounts when very hungry (Everist 1974; Stanley & Ross 1983; Cunningham et al. 1992; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The sharp-pointed fruits are troublesome to animals such as dogs and sheep, and the spiny fruits can cause lameness. Sheep have developed blackleg from infection of wounds to the feet caused by the spiny fruits.\n\nNative ecosystems: Spiny Emex also occurs as a weed in national parks and nature reserves, usually in disturbed sites such as roads, tracks, firebreaks, picnic areas, old homesteads and clearings. However, it can also impact on biodiversity and the environment by invading natural areas such as the edges of creeks, riverine flats, alluvial flats (claypans, edges of saline lakes) and rocky areas (Keighery 1996).\n\nUrban areas: The Spiny fruits can also puncture small tyres, such as those of bicycles, and restrict the use of recreation areas, particularly where people are bare-footed and spines can penetrate light footwear (Cunningham et al. 1992; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty and Associates 2005; VicFora 2016).",

    "habitat": "Elodea grows in temperate regions, less commonly in subtropical and tropical regions, in a range of water situations such as clear, cold to warm, still to turbulent or sometimes swift/fast-flowing freshwaters of lakes, quiet ponds, reservoirs, streams, channels, drains and wetlands, at depths to 3 m and, occasionally, to 5 m or more. It is a major weed of irrigation channels. Elodea prefers peaty or muddy silt substrate, is tolerant of cold and can withstand freezing, tolerates battering and tangling in turbulent water, but does not thrive in water deprived of iron. It appears to have a high light requirement for maximum growth, tolerates slightly brackish waters, and grows vigorously once water temperatures exceed 15 °C. Growth is affected by nutrient levels, variation in light intensity, day length, light quality and temperature (Aston 1973; Cook & Urmi-König 1985; Cunningham et al. 1992; Jacobs 1993; Bowmer et al. 1984, 1995; Holm et al. 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty & Jacobs 1981, 2003; Weber 2003; Richardson et al. 2006).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Dense infestations of Elodea can reduce water flow by as much as 60–80% and, in reservoirs, interfere with hydroelectric output, making it is one of several water weeds that can cause commercial losses to hydropower stations and urban water supplies in New Zealand. On rivers, lakes and other waterbodies, dense tangled mats disrupt waterway traffic and navigation, limit recreational use by impeding activities such as boating, swimming and fishing and significantly alter the aquatic environment (Holm et al. 1997; Thorp & Wilson 1998; Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nWhen Elodea invades lakes, streams and wetlands, it can reduce the abundance of native aquatic plants or replace species as its dense closed stands out-compete or greatly impede the growth of native aquatic plants. Aquatic environments and habitats will be altered by heavy infestations, with potential impacts on wildlife (Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Weber 2003). Light intensity, temperature, oxygen content and pH of the water are reduced which affects the solubility of dissolved salts, the nutrient status of the water and, as a result, fish numbers (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Elodea has also invaded constructed wetlands (Gunasekera 2003) and shows a higher dispersal capacity via fragmentation than its weedy relatives Egeria densa and Lagarosiphon major (Redekop et al. 2016).\n\nAgriculture: Elodea is an obstructive and persistent aquatic weed of irrigation supply and drainage channels. Its spread in irrigation systems can threaten irrigated agriculture by greatly reducing water flow and sometimes by causing channels to overflow (Aston 1973; Mitchell 1978; Bowmer et al. 1979, 1984, 1995; Sainty & Jacobs 1981, 2003; Holm et al. 1997; Flanagan 1998; Richardson et al. 2006).",
    "controlMethods": "Once established, Elodea is extremely difficult to eradicate. Mechanical removal measures such as using booms, draglines, cutting, hand-pulling and cultivation of beds tend to encourage spread by fragmentation of the stems. Such actions are also often slow and expensive, and will only provide temporary relief (Sainty & Jacobs 1981, 2003; Holm et al. 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Weber 2003).\n\nNon-chemical control: Land management: Lowering water levels in channels, small dams or other water bodies can be an economical, safe and effective control for Elodea if they are completely drained and dried, preferably in summer to expose the weed to desiccation by sun and wind, or exposing the sediments to winter frosts (Bowmer et al. 1995; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Shading the water surface of infested waterbodies can substantially reduce the growth rate (Holm et al. 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Weber 2003).\n\nStudies in irrigation systems show that control measures should be applied in early summer when populations are approaching nuisance size, and again in late summer before fragmentation occurs and over-wintering propagules are initiated (Bowmer et al. 1984).\n\nPrevention is the most effective means of control and Elodea should not be introduced to unaffected areas and aquarium plants must not be dumped or grown in waterways. Management should aim to prevent the introduction of the weed to new areas and also focus on early detection and eradication (Flanagan 1998). Growing more suitable aquatic plants in ponds and aquaria should be encouraged (Lawrence et al. 2005).\n\nChemical control: is possible through the use of approved herbicides (Bowmer et al. 1979, 1984, 1995; Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Peirce & Pratt 2002; Weber 2003; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food undated). Methods include the treatment of flowing water by injection of chemicals, treatment of ponded or static water, and post-drainage treatment of channel beds. In irrigation channels, where draining and drying are not feasible, biomass is successfully reduced by widespread use of herbicides (Bowmer et al. 1995; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "impact": "Tobacco Weed was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Tobacco Weed was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: Tobacco Weed is a vigorous and aggressive weed of agriculture in many tropical and subtropical countries and is considered to be a major threat to the beef and dairy industries of north Queensland. It is an extremely competitive species with seeds capable of germinating under and growing through thick pasture with the Tobacco Weed smothering grasses and reducing pasture productivity. The plant is not a nutritious feed for cattle and reduces pasture productivity within a few years (Land Protection 2006).",
    "controlMethods": "Tobacco Weed is difficult to control because the plant is a prolific seeder and seed banks develop in the soil. Control must be repeated a number of times to exhaust soil borne seeds. Tobacco Weed becomes increasingly difficult to kill with herbicides once the plant has begun to flower (and possibly as early as at the beginning of stem growth) (Land Protection 2006).\n\nNon-chemical control: In far northern Australia, the wet season may limit access to pastures and not provide opportunities for control until after seed production has occurred. Property hygiene such as ensuring machinery, vehicles and livestock are free of seed before moving between paddocks and other properties, is an essential factor in controlling spread.\n\nChemical control: In cultivation, Tobacco Weed can be readily controlled by spraying with herbicide, with careful follow-up monitoring needed as Tobacco Weed show a pronounced ability to regrow after treatment. Slashing has been used to switch reproductive plants back to the vegetative mode, to allow treatment with herbicide (Land Protection 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.",

    "habitat": "Water Hyacinth grows on still or slow-flowing water, in freshwater rivers and other watercourses, lakes, swamps, lagoons on river floodplains, reservoirs and farm dams. It prefers and proliferates in nutrient-rich, subtropical and tropical conditions. It does not thrive or barely survives in fresh clean water such as good-quality tap water (Sainty & Jacobs 1981; Sainty & Associates 2001). Water Hyacinth persists on saturated soils; plants lying in mud grow at a reduced rate (Aston 1973; Sainty & Jacobs 1981). Although it grows most rapidly in warmer areas it will survive a fair degree of cold, including occasional light frosts (Romanowski 1998), but is killed by salt water (Aston 1973).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Water Hyacinth is a Weed of National Significance (WONS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nWater Hyacinth is declared as a noxious plant in all states and territories and is on the World Conservation Union’s list of the world’s 100 worst invasive alien species (ISSG 2000). It is a highly invasive aquatic plant that has become a pest of waterways around the world. It grows aggressively in nutrient-rich stationary or slow-moving freshwater to quickly form dense mats. A single plant has been known to develop in one season into a patch covering about 600 square metres (Aston 1973).\n\nThese mats rapidly degrade environments in various ways. They block and choke waterbodies, obstructing water flows in natural watercourses, natural and constructed lakes and ponds, irrigation and flood mitigation channels, and reservoirs and dams. This in turn interferes with and reduces boating, fishing, swimming and other water recreational activities. They can block water pumps, inlets of boat engine water cooling systems and other equipment, and have the potential to interfere with hydro-electric generators. Masses can build-up at bridges, fences and other structures especially during floods, creating a dam and endangering the structure (Sainty & Jacobs 2003).\n\nInfestations reduce water quality as rotting vegetation reduces the oxygen content and fouls the water, impacting on native plants and animals and making water unfit for drinking by humans and livestock. Biodiversity will decline as dense mats reduce light levels, temperature and oxygen in the water below, excluding native aquatic plant species, and altering or destroying natural wetlands and habitat for native invertebrates, amphibians, fish and birds.\n\nIncreased loss of water through transpiration (Sainty & Jacobs 1981) has impacts on water storage and supply.\n\nWater Hyacinth infestations can limit access by stock and wildlife to water, and are a potential hazard to young children and livestock if they become entangled in dense vegetation. It can provide shelter for mosquitoes and other disease-spreading organisms (Sainty & Jacobs 2003). Dense mats may be colonised by other plant species and greatly accelerate freshwater succession (Weber 2003), aging a wetland.\n\nSome of the uses of Water Hyacinth are described by Saint & Jacobs (1981) and Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001).",
    "controlMethods": "Water Hyacinth is declared as a noxious plant in all states and territories. It has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.\n\nWater Hyacinth can be extremely costly to control once infestations are allowed to spread so preventing its spread into uninfested areas is vital. Reduce nutrient levels entering waterbodies to lower the risk of invasion and spread (Muyt 2001). It should not be cultivated or grown in garden ponds (Sainty & Jacobs 2003) and pond material must not be discarded into waterbodies\n\nNon-chemical control: Small infestations can be removed by hand. Harvester machines are required for clearing larger areas (Weber 2003). The weight of plant material can be enormous, making physical removal only appropriate where suitable equipment is available or infestations are easily accessible (Muyt 2001). Removed material must be disposed of properly, such as drying and burning (Land Protection 2007).\n\nChemical control: There are several herbicides effective on Water Hyacinth and these need to be approved for use in aquatic environments. Contact your local council or weed control authority for advice on weed control. Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nFollow-up programs and monitoring will be required after physical removal or chemical control due to the likelihood of regeneration from seed which can survive in mud and sediments for many years. Waterbodies such as farm dams can be drained to kill existing plants, but plants are likely to grow from the stored seed bank so ongoing monitoring and treatments will be required.\n\nBiological control:  It has been effective in some tropical regions (Sainty & Associates 2001), but with little or no impact in cooler climates (Muyt 2001). Information on biocontrol is provided by Forno & Wright (1981), Harley (1981), Waterhouse (1994), Wright & Purcell (1995), Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001), Center et al. (2002), Burton (2005), CSIRO Entomology (2005, no date), Kathiresan (2005) and Land Protection (2007).\n\nControl is best through a combination of habitat manipulation (denying the plant water may be possible in some situations), biological control agents and approved herbicides (Sainty & Jacobs 2003). Mechanical removal of dead plants will help avoid water quality degradation by masses of rotting plants (Plant Protection 2007). Integrated control programs, including continued monitoring, will control and prevent the further spread of Water Hyacinth (Wright & Purcell 1995; Muyt 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Burton 2005; Land Protection 2007).",
    "origin": "Water Hyacinth is native to the Amazon Basin in South America, but is now introduced and widespread as an aquatic weed throughout warm freshwaters of the world. It was spread from the late 1800s as an attractive ornamental plant for water features. It mainly occurs in tropical to temperate climatic zones to latitudes around 40 degrees (Aston 1973; Sainty & Jacobs 1981; Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Weber 2003).",
    "growthForm": "Herb, Aquatic",
    "similarSpecies": "Water Hyacinth is similar to the aquatic weeds Water Lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) and Salvinia (Salvinia molesta) in forming floating obstructive mats, but it is readily distinguished by its showy, pale blue to lavender flowers with a darker purple and yellow blotch, and by having some leaves with a swollen, buoyant base to their leaf stalk.\n\nA related exotic plant is Blue Pickerel Weed (Pontederia cordata), which is often planted as an ornamental around garden water features but is a taller plant rooted in soil at the water’s edge. It also has glossy spoon-shaped leaves and tall crowded spikes of smaller mauve or rarely white flowers. The native plant Ornduffia reniformis [as Villarsia reniformis] has glossy, fleshy, kidney-shaped leaves, the back of which is dotted with dark pores. It is usually found in shallow or temporary pools where it is rooted in mud at the water’s edge, sending out long runners. Its flowers are yellow with 5 petals. (Southern Tablelands and South Coast Noxious Plants Committee, no date).\n\nThe native Monochoria cyanea, from the same family as Water Hyacinth, occurs in north-central New South Wales and northern Australia but it has sprawling, elongated stems, remains anchored to the bottom of water bodies, and does not have the swollen leaf stalks or petal markings found in the later species.",

It smothers the surface of creeks, lakes and other water bodies (Jordan 2007).\n\nNative ecosystems: Its potential impact is similar to that of Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) which obstructs waterways, interferes with irrigation systems and hydro-electric generation, removes oxygen from the water thereby reducing fish production, harbours mosquitoes and other vectors of disease, reduces areas available for waterbirds and causes significant water loss due to transpiration where there are dense infestations (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nAnchored Water Hyacinth is closely related to Water Hyacinth which is considered one of the world's most serious aquatic weeds and is a declared noxious weed in many countries. Due to the weed status of Water Hyacinth and Anchored Water Hyacinth, several, and in some cases, all species of Eichhornia have been subsequently designated as prohibited imports in various countries, including Australia (Winterton & Scher 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Anchored Water Hyacinth is not known in Australia, so prevention of its establishment is the best form of control. Overseas, small infestations are removed by hand. There are several herbicides available for the control of Water Hyacinth in Australia but none are currently registered for Anchored Water Hyacinth.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nAlthough large infestations of Water Hyacinth are controlled through mechanical harvesting, this may not be as effective for Anchored Water Hyacinth due to its anchored habit (Johnson undated).",

    "growthForm": "Aquatic",
    "similarSpecies": "Anchored Water Hyacinth (E. azurea) and Water Hyacinth (E. crassipes) are very similar, but Anchored Water Hyacinth is rooted in the mud rather than free-floating and the leaf stalks of Anchored Water Hyacinth are always slender, whereas those of Water Hyacinth have bladder-like swellings, bulbous or elongate, which enable the plant to float. As the Water Hyacinth plants become more densely packed, the leaf stalks produced are longer and thinner (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Winterton & Scher 2007; Johnson undated).\n\nAnchored Water Hyacinth is also similar to the native plant Monochoria cyanea which is a subtropical species found in northern Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, with isolated occurrences in New South Wales (AVH 2008). Anchored Water Hyacinth is distinguished by the larger flowers, a longer and denser flower head, the upper petal with the yellow spot in the middle and almost round leaves, compared to the pointed, elliptic or egg-shaped leaves of M. cyanea (Jacobs 1993).",

    "habitat": "Dense Waterweed occurs mostly in warm temperate to tropical regions, although it is also tolerant of cold. It grows in stationary or slowly flowing water, especially where the substrate has been disturbed. It is an occasional weed of mild to warm freshwater ponds, shallow lakes, water holes, reservoirs, ditches and slowly flowing streams, especially in conditions of high nutrient levels. It grows at water depths of up to 7 m and has very low light requirement. Growth is affected by nutrient status, light intensity, day length, temperature and rate of water flow (Jacobs 1993; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Stephens & Dowling 2002; Weber 2003; Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water 2008; Johnson undated). Dense Waterweed does not appear to persist in intermittently flowing streams or those subject to flooding (Thorp & Wilson 1998 – ).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Dense Waterweed can become a nuisance in ponds, shallow lakes, slow-moving streams and irrigation channels (Cunningham et al. 1992; Richardson et al. 2006). It is capable of forming extremely dense, submerged masses that can seriously retard water flow, increase siltation, choke irrigation channels and clog equipment, impede hydroelectric activity, potable water supplies and navigation in water ways (retarding river traffic) and impede commercial fishing operations as well as recreational activities such as boating, fishing and swimming activities (Mühlberg 1982; Thorp & Wilson 1998 -; Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Global Invasive Species Database 2006; Jordan 2007).\n\nDense Waterweed impacts on natural wetland and lake communities, where dense stands will reduce or replace native aquatic plants and animals. As well as out-competing native macrophytes, this weed alters habitat conditions. The thick mats of intertwining stems reduce light intensity, deplete oxygen and can cause fluctuations in water quality (Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Champion 2002; Weber 2003; Global Invasive Species Database 2006; PIER 2007; Johnson undated).",
    "controlMethods": "Hand-pulling, cutting and digging with machines can be used to control Dense Waterweed but these methods will usually only provide temporary relief. This is because mechanical control methods will actually encourage its spread as vegetative fragments will form new plants (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). All control methods need to be thorough and either kill or remove all of the plants to prevent regrowth from stem pieces (Jordan 2007). After mechanical removal, plants can be destroyed by drying and burning or burying (Miller & Schultz 1998; Johnson undated). Control through water level fluctuations may be possible in some situations, e.g., flushing or draining channels or dams (Stephens & Dowling 2002; Sainty & Jacobs 2003; Washington State Department of Ecology 2003). Long-term management is likely to involve both increased and variable water flows and reduced nutrient loading (Johnson undated).\n\nChemical control is possible, but herbicide treatments need to be approved and are limited by environmental constraints when used within water bodies, wetlands, water sources and irrigation systems (Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Peirce & Pratt 2002; Washington State Department of Ecology 2003; Weber 2003; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food undated).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nAquatic weeds can be extremely expensive to eradicate and so prevention is better than cure, especially with these kinds of plants (Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2006). Preventing this weed escaping into water ways is the best way of managing it and so aquarium or pond plants should never be dumped or grown in water ways (Johnson undated; see also Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2006). It is also important to encourage the growing of more suitable aquatic plants in ponds and aquaria (CRC 2005; Lawrence et al. 2005). Dense Waterweed is prohibited and banned from sale in several states and territories (Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2006 undated; Johnson undated).\n\nIntegrated management plans and control measures for Dense Waterweed are outlined by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water (2008). Planning and implementation of an integrated control program aims at eradicating all existing populations and preventing future infestations of Dense Waterweed. Such a program should include as a minimum: an inventory of Dense Waterweed infestations in the relevant area, well-defined objectives, practicable control actions, follow-up actions, a realistic timeline and a budget.

Could invade and impact similar habitats as the invasive Echium plantageneum (Patersons Curse, Salvation Jane). In New South Wales it is naturalised in disturbed places and pastoral land where it is declared as an Echium species.\n\nAgriculture: Weed of pasture, crops, disturbed areas, fallows, lucerne, roadsides and disturbed areas and potentially competitive in pasture and crops. In New South Wales it is naturalised in disturbed places and pastoral land where it is declared as an Echium species. Viper's Bugloss is less palatable to stock than Paterson's Curse and is less competitive with desirable pasture species. It also contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids and is potentially toxic to livestock and can be poisonous (DPI NSW 2019; DPIWE 2002). The plant is also covered in hairs which can cause irritation to the skin when touched (Piggin 1997).\n\nNative ecosystems: In Victoria, Viper's Bugloss invades lowland grassland, grassy woodland and dry sclerophyll forest (Carr et al. 1992).\n\nUrban areas: As a weed of disturbed sites, it invades roadsides, waterways, gardens and parks, disturbed sites and waste areas in the temperate regions of Australia (Queensland Government 2016).",
    "controlMethods": "Viper's Bugloss (Echium vulgare) can be controlled by herbicides, cultivation and management and maintaining healthy pastures and cropping practices. Viper's Bugloss often establishes after overgrazing, cultivation or other disturbance and then prevents other more desirable species establishing. The management techniques to control Paterson's curse, can be applied to control viper's bugloss, including the biocontrol options.\n\nChemical control:  Chemical control of Viper's Bugloss in cropping and non-cropping situations can also be successful (DPIWE 2002). Cultivation and herbicides provide good control in cropping situations. Spray grazing, early in the season gives very economical reductions in broad acre pasture infestations  Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Isolated plants can be manually removed and burnt if flowering or seeding.\n\nMechanical control: Mowing can reduce seed set but usually requires an early mow at the bud stage and a late mow to control regrowth.\n\nCompetition and management: The key to preventing seedling establishment is to aim for full ground cover by using competitive crops or pastures. Cultivation can be used to control Viper's Bugloss, with multiple cultivations are usually required to control late germinating seeds. Cultivation followed by sowing of competitive crop species can be a useful control technique. Grazing with sheep rather than cattle to prevent seed set can help reduce seed set.\n\nBiological Control: Bio control agents introduced to control Paterson's Curse will probably also affect Viper's Bugloss. The Heliotrope moth (Utetheisa pulchelloides) is a white spotted moth and often seen in Heliotrope and Echium infestations.

In Australia, Paterson's Curse is a weed of roadsides, waste places and pastures, and sometimes occurs as a weed in crops (Piggin & Sheppard 1995). It prefers sandy, acid soils, although it may be found on a wide range of soil types. It is well suited to the Mediterranean-type climatic conditions that are found across large areas of southern Australia (Piggin & Sheppard 1995).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Patersons' Curse was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Paterson's Curse was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: Paterson's Curse can form very extensive, dense, persistent populations in disturbed areas. It is a very competitive and dominant species, especially in areas where grazing pressure is low and soil fertility is high (Piggin & Sheppard 1995). Its high early growth rate, stout taproot and large smothering rosette leaves enable it to compete vigorously with seedlings of native and useful pasture species (Muyt 2001; Weber 2003). Early germination, coupled with a fast-growing root system, contribute to the competitive success of this species (Piggin & Sheppard 1995). Significant drought resistance of seedlings explains why Paterson's Curse is abundant in years when summer rainfalls are followed by periods of drought (Piggin & Sheppard 1995).\n\nNative ecosystems: In Victoria, it is considered a potential threat to two plant species listed under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988: Diuris dendrobioides [as Diuris cuneata] (Wedge Diuris) and (Cullen parvum) [as Psoralea parva] (Small Psoralea) (Adair & Groves 1998).\n\nIt is sometimes considered a useful fodder species, especially the young growth which is readily eaten by stock, particularly sheep (DPIW 2002). However, it contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that can be toxic to livestock. Consumption of the plant can result in chronic liver damage and mortality, especially if substantial amounts are eaten over prolonged periods (Auld & Medd 1987; Piggin & Sheppard 1995). Deaths of animals due to plant toxicity are rare and can be avoided with good pasture and livestock management (Piggin & Sheppard 1995).\n\nHuman and livestock contact with the abrasive hairs on the plant can cause dermatitis, itching and inflammation (Auld & Medd 1987; Piggin & Sheppard 1995). It can also trigger hayfever (Naughton et al. 2006). Nationwide it has been estimated that 33 million ha of land is infested with Paterson's Curse (Faithfull & McLaren 2004) and that the total cost of Paterson's Curse to Australia's sheep and cattle producers is estimated at $250 million per year (DSE 2004).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Physical control: Physical control methods, such as hand hoeing and pulling are suitable for isolated plants. Flowering plants should be destroyed (e.g. by burning) as the seeds will continue to mature even after the plant has been cut, pulled or hoed. Grazing, particularly by sheep, is effective when managed correctly. Cultivation can also control Paterson's Curse.\n\nChemical control: Paterson's Curse is susceptible to a number of herbicides. Herbicides should be applied at the seedling or rosette stage and when the plant is actively growing to be most effective (DPIW 2002; DSE 2004). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nBiological control: Paterson's Curse has been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. A number of insects have been released since the first attempt at biological control in 1980 in an effort to provide long term control, particularly of large infestations (DPIW 2002; Naughton et al. 2006).\n\nNumerous fact sheets and handbooks have been produced in Australia discussing the various management techniques for dealing with Paterson's Curse and preventing it from establishing. For further information on management of Paterson's Curse, including chemical, physical and biological control, see Morely & Stapleton (1999), the Department of Primary Industries Water and Environment Tasmania (2002), the Department of Sustainability and Environment Victoria (2004), Faithfull & McLaren (2004), Naughton et al. (2006) and the Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia (2007). Alternatively, contact the relevant weed management agency in your state or territory.",
    "origin": "Paterson's Curse is native to central, southern and eastern Europe, the British Isles and the Mediterranean Islands. It is also native to northern Africa, temperate Asia, the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores (Gibbs 1972; Weber 2003).",

    "similarSpecies": "Viper's Bugloss (Echium vulgare) is a closely related species which may be confused with Paterson's Curse. It has a blue instead of purple flower and the flowers are shorter (12-15 mm long) than those of Paterson's Curse (20-30 mm long). Italian Bugloss (Echium italicum) resembles Paterson's Curse but can be distinguished easily when it is in flower because the flowers are pale yellow or cream. Lucerne (Medicago sativa) superficially resembles Paterson's Curse when it is in flower. It is a similar sized plant with purple flowers, although the stems and leaves of lucerne are not hairy. For further information on identifying Paterson's Curse see Morley and Faithfull (2004).",

Cat's Claw Creeper is most commonly naturalised in the vegetation along waterways and in disturbed rainforests. It is also found in open woodlands, plantations, waste areas, disturbed sites, along roadsides, and growing over fences and old buildings (Navie 2007). Cat's Claw Creeper is highly tolerant of low light situations, though it is much more vigorous in sunny gaps and on the edges of forests (McClymont 1996).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Cat's Claw Creeper is a Weed of National Significance (WONS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nNative ecosystems: Cat's Claw Creeper has the ability to completely smother native vegetation, even growing up over tall trees, and many bushland areas in eastern Australia have serious infestations of this species (Land Protection 2006). It can grow as a ground cover along the forest floor of scrub remnants and form a thick carpet of stems and leaves which chokes out small existing plants and prevents the germination of all other species. The large climbing stems can also reach to the top of the rainforest canopy where, through a combination of weight and shading, they can cause the eventual death of the largest canopy trees (McClymont 1996). The vigorous and extensive root system, which produces large tubers at about 50 cm intervals, also adds to the difficulty of controlling this weed (McClymont 1996; Land Protection 2006). Cat's Claw Creeper is particularly aggressive in riparian vegetation in south-eastern Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales, but is also a potential threat to riparian and rainforest plant communities throughout the sub-tropical and tropical zones of eastern and northern Australia (Csurhes & Edwards 1998). It was recently ranked as the fourth most invasive alien plant species in south-eastern Queensland (Batianoff & Butler 2002), and is currently regarded as a priority environmental weed in five Natural Resource Management regions.",
    "controlMethods": "Dense infestations of cat's claw creeper are very difficult to control due to its numerous lianas, abundant seed and ability to resprout from the tubers, sometimes for years. In selecting the most suitable control techniques it is essential to minimise adverse impacts on native vegetation and to encourage its subsequent recovery. The methods chosen should be adapted to the type of native vegetation invaded, stage in the restoration program, size and growth stage of the weeds and level of infestation. Weeding should proceed gradually as creation of large gaps can lead to further weed invasion. Follow up is essential. Regrowth should be treated before it reaches the foliage of the host tree, or the hanging ends of previously cut stems of cat's claw creeper. Regrowth may require treatment for five or more years and ongoing monitoring is needed (NSW Weedwise, 2020).\n\nPhysical control: Use a pruning saw, machete or brush hook to cut all leads/stems up the trees. All above the cut will die, but regrowth will occur from the underground tubers (QLD DAF, 2020). Digging the underground tubers out is not practical in most cases. They tend to break off easily and are incredibly difficult to dig out. Each tuber must be dug out completely and this involves significant soil disturbance at the infested site, which causes damage the roots of the surrounding native vegetation (Land Protection 2006; McClymont 1996).\n\nChemical control: The stems of individual vines should be cut close to the ground with a pruning saw, machete or brush hook. The basal end should be quickly painted with herbicide, and the upper part of the vine can be left to die off over time. The poison translocates down the stem and into the tuberous root system killing the entire plant. However, it must be applied within 15 seconds of cutting, while the sap is still running (Land Protection 2006; McClymont 1996). Vines with a diameter larger than 1 cm can receive an additional application of herbicide on a scraped section of the remaining stem (Achilles 2003).\n\nGround cover carpets of cat's claw creeper and any re-growth can also be foliar sprayed to great effect. Because of the multitude of tubers, re-growth is inevitable and careful monitoring is usually required over some time (Land Protection 2006; McClymont 1996). In general, follow-up can commence between three and six weeks after primary control and follow-up spraying can be required for up to five years after primary control (Achilles 2003).\n\nBiological control:  Several biological control agents have been identified and are at various stages of testing and introduction. Australian releases of the leaf-sucking lace bug (Carvalhotingis visenda) and leaf-tying pyralid moth (Hypocosmia pyrochroma) were approved in 2007 (Johnson 2011). A new agent, the leaf-mining buprestid beetle (Hylaeogena jurecki) was released in 2012–13 (Dhileepan et al 2013).\n\nCheck with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for Cat's Claw Creeper control.

    "habitat": "False Yellowhead usually prefers, but is not restricted to, high rainfall areas. It can be found on both clay and sandy soils. In southwestern Western Australia it is found in areas of medium to high rainfall (i.e. where rainfall exceeds 400 mm per year). It is more reliant on moisture than the closely related Stinkwort (Dittrichia graveolens), which is a weed of grazing land and roadsides of much of southern Australia. In southwestern Western Australia nearly all records of False Yellowhead are from highly disturbed sites: road verges ), firebreaks  and walking trails. Of the three records from bushland, all are from disturbed sites in swamps (Lake Seppings, Mount Manypeaks, and a creek line and swamp at Emu Point) (CRC 2003; DPI).",

    "impact": "False Yellowhead (Dittrichia viscosa) is on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 non-native plants that threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage. Although only in the early stages of establishment, these weeds have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems (CRC 2003). A weed of roadsides, railways and disturbed areas.\n\nFalse Yellowhead, like Stinkwort (Dittrichia graveolens), can cause health problems in humans and animals. In humans the oil on the leaves and stems causes contact dermatitis, resulting in itching and blistering skin especially if handled when in flower, with some people are allergic to the aromatic oils.\n\nAgriculture: Taints milk and meat but not usually grazed by stock. May not impact well managed pastures but could invade bare areas, or degraded and poorly managed pastures.\n\nNative ecosystems: Infestations of False Yellowhead would detract from the aesthetic and natural values of bushland and could reduce its tourism appeal. The costs of management (e.g. clearing from railway lines or walking trails) would also be significant (CRC 2003).\n\nUrban areas: Known to invade park and garden in Western Australia, and a weed of roadsides.",
    "controlMethods": "False Yellowhead (Dittrichia viscosa) can be controlled by physical and mechanical means, and herbicides. Older plants with flowers treated with herbicide may produce seed, so may need to be treated by mechanical means. Plants with flowers that slashed or mown may also produce seed and need to be bagged and dumped, or put in heaps and burned to prevent seed production and subsequently dispersal and spread in the area. Timing is important to kill or manage plants to prevent seed set. Seeds are viable for extended periods able to endure many years of dormancy if deprived of light. Because there are relatively few False Yellowhead infestations, it can be eradicated before it becomes established, and it is highly recommended that any new outbreaks should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Do not try to control False Yellowhead without expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: False Yellowhead can be sprayed with herbicide. In Western Australia spraying some roadside infestations of False Yellowhead has been encouraging with good kill rates helped by the clumping of plants, although it has been important to spray before seed set. Occasionally, applying herbicide to the stump has been used to treat larger plants. (CRC 2003)\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Before False Yellowhead flowers, isolated plants or small patches can be hand-pulled (wearing gloves), or use a fork to remove plants, minimising soil disturbance. Follow-up manual weeding of previously sprayed patches of any False Yellowhead plants is recommended to minimising disturbance to the soil and reducing the likelihood of germination of False Yellowhead weed seeds in the soil seedbank.\n\nMechanical control: Small areas can be mechanically removed. Plants in flower must be burnt as seed will develop from the nutrient reserves in the stem if left on the ground. In roadside cases some control has been achieved by regular mowing before flowering and seeding. However, protective clothing must be worn because mowing can release the irritating oils that are stored in the leaves (CRC 2003).\nCompetition and management: Cultivation of larger plants is only effective if done before flowering during dry weather. Regrowth often occurs if adequate soil moisture is present.\nAll cut dead plant material in bud or flower can still form seeds if left on the ground after removal. These cut dead plants need to be bagged and dumped, or put in heaps and burned to prevent seed production.",

    "habitat": "Stinkwort (Dittrichia graveolens) is one of the most widespread weeds in the southern half of Australia, found in the cool to warm temperate areas. Climatically, Stinkwort is adapted to a temperate, ‘Mediterranean-type’ climate with an annual rainfall of 300–800 mm, falling predominantly in winter. While it can persist in warmer, sub-humid areas, and arid areas, these climate zone appears very marginal, outside if preferred ecological zone (State of Queensland, 2016).\n\nIt grows in virtually any open, disturbed sites, such as overgrazed pastures, roadsides and vacant lots, mainly on sandy or otherwise light-textured soils. It typically colonises bare sites where there is poor competition from other plants (State of Queensland, 2016). Also is found on railway reserves, river flats, grazing land,  with a preference for depressions (Jeanes 1999; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; National Herbarium of Victoria 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Stinkwort (Dittrichia graveolens) is a weed of pastures, crops, lucerne, fallows, roadsides, railways, slightly saline areas, summer moist areas, watercourses, summer crops and irrigated and disturbed areas. Historically, the species was mainly a weed of agricultural areas, but it is also regarded as an environmental weed in some areas invading conservation areas. Stinkwort exudes a strong-smelling oil from glands on most parts of the plant. This causes allergic contact dermatitis in some people.\n\nAgriculture: Although reported as toxic and poisonous to livestock, little evidence exists that it is toxic, although oxalate poisoning has been reported when it is grazed, and fishermen in southern Italy reportedly use the macerated leaves to stun fish. Grazing animals appear to find Stinkwort fairly unpalatable, eating the plant only when it is very young, when little else is available. The oil also taints meat and milk of animals forced to graze the plant (Mitchell & Rook 1979; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Flora of North America undated). Discolours wool but it comes out during scouring.\n\nNative ecosystems: While Stinkwort is mainly a weed of agricultural land and highly disturbed sites, it is also rated a potential threat to dry coastal vegetation, mallee shrubland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, and dry sclerophyll forest and woodland (Carr et al. 1992). It primarily occurs on land subjected to grazing or other disturbance (e.g. roadsides), but also grows along waterways (i.e. in riparian zones), in wetlands and in coastal habitats (Queensland Government 2016).\n\nUrban areas: A weed of roadsides and waste place especially in agricultural and regional areas.",
    "controlMethods": "Stinkwort (Dittrichia graveolens) can be controlled by physical and mechanical means, and herbicides. Treatment should be carried on young plants early in the season when the plant in rosette form, before flowering. Older plants with flowers and seeds are tolerant to herbicides, and plants sprayed when in flower  may set seed and regrow. Plants treated by mechanical means (slashing and mowing) will also regrow and will need follow-up. In addition, slashed or mown cut dead flowering material may develop viable seed and should be removed from sites. Timing it important to kill or manage plants to prevent seed set, with seeds viable for only three years. Reducing the soil seed bank is the goal to reduce or eradicate Stinkwort from an area. Control programs should also address the reasons why Stinkwort has become a weed in a particular area. These include; over-grazed; bare areas;  poor and degraded soil with nutritional deficiencies; soil salinity. Better management and introducing more suitable cover species to consume summer moisture may help.\n\nChemical control: Stinkwort can also be sprayed with herbicide, particularly in the young growth stages (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Older plants are relatively tolerant of herbicides including glyphosate, metsulfuron and hormone herbicides. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Isolated plants or small patches of Stinkwort can be hand-pulled (wearing gloves) before they flower. Plants in flower need to be put in heaps and burned to prevent continued growth and seed production.\n\nMechanical control: Large areas can be cultivated or slashed before flowering, but repeat treatment of regrowth may be needed a few weeks later. Mowing reduces seeding, but is effective only if is cut very close to the ground and repeated. Regrowth often occurs if adequate soil moisture is present.Small areas can be mechanically removed. All dead cut plant material in bud or flower can still form seeds if left on the ground after removal. These cut plants need to be bagged and dumped, or put in heaps and burned to prevent continued seed production. Cultivation of larger plants is only effective if done before flowering.\nCompetition and management: The application of super-phosphate in autumn and winter to stimulate strong pasture growth is an effective way of out-competing and eliminating Stinkwort. Heavy grazing by sheep when the plants are young is also helpful in controlling this weed, but cattle are not as effective.",

Populations of Sand Rocket resistant to Group B/2 herbicides have been discovered in cereal crops in South Australia (Preston 2005).

A possible threat to forestry, horticultural crops, and orchards if allowed to establish.\n\nNative ecosystems:  weed capable of smothering and out-competing native vegetation by climbing over shrubs, up tree branches and across ground flora to form loose mats up to 30 cm thick that prevent regeneration of native species (Blood 2001; Muyt 2001). It can kill shrubs and trees, resulting in light gaps and leading to more weed invasion (Blue Mountains City Council Bushcare 2002).

There are associated negative impacts on fauna because of habitat degradation and loss of plant species.\n\nStudies in the United States have identified chemicals in Cape Ivy that make it unsuitable food for most fauna, and toxic to mammals, spiders and fish (California Invasive Plant Council undated).\n\nUrban areas:  It can also occur as a weed in disturbed urban situations, such as on fences along railway verges (Reid 2008 pers. comm.).",

Remove the root system or treat with herbicide using the cut and paint method when controlling Cape Ivy, otherwise it will regrow.

Larger infestations commonly require follow up treatments over the next 1–2 years (Muyt 2001). Cut and paint method can be used to stop treated plant regrowing,\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Small infestations of Cape Ivy can be removed manually. Climbing stems can be severed at the base and left to dry out in the canopy. Broken stem pieces must be collected and removed from the site to prevent them from taking root (Muyt 2001).\n\nMechanical control: Not normally used as this method damages the plants or supporting structures Cape Ivy grows over. Mechanical control also breaks up the stems that be spread further taking root forming new plants, increasing density and distribution of infestations.\nCompetition and management: Toxic to stock causing liver damage after long and continuous consumption.",

    "controlMethods": "The biology of Wild Carrot is a critical consideration in preventing or controlling wild carrot infestations. The ultimate goal of controlling wild carrot, regardless of the method, should be to prevent seed production because seeds are the only means of reproduction, and they are relatively short-lived in the soil (Stolarczyk 2007). However, healthy wild carrot plants can produce as many as 1,000-40,000 seeds per plant, and seeds can live and germinate over a seven-year period or longer.\n\nHerbicide application (chemical control) is not normally the best option for established wild carrot on farms. Grazing management and mechanical clipping plants before they set seed is likely to be more effective and economical. Viable seed will remain in the soil profile and be viable for a seven-year period or longer, so control options requires long term commitment.\n\nChemical control: Wild Carrot can be controlled by herbicides at three stages of growth: plants germinated before winter can be controlled with early pre-plant, pre-emergence or post-emergence herbicide applications; established plants with autumn herbicide applications; and seedlings with pre-emergence or post-emergence herbicide applications. Established plants are generally more difficult to control than seedlings (Stolarczyk 2007).\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand-pulling or mowing during the first year, when the plants are 18 to 26 cm tall, can be effective (Eckardt 1987 in Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007).\n\nCompetition and management: Mowing or clipping at late flowering stage reduces wild carrot size and seed production. Plowing and planting a cultivated crop for two years may decrease infestations. Frequent cultivation promotes seed germination, which depletes the soil seed bank and destroys seedlings before they can mature and reproduce (Muenscher 1980). Grazing – sheep, horses and cattle will graze wild carrot.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "similarSpecies": "Wild Carrot differs from the native Daucus glochidiatus in having a large flat-topped inflorescence with numerous many-flowered umbrella-shaped flower clusters and fruit with short hairs and spines, whereas the native species has an inflorescence of a few small clusters, each with a few flowers, and fruit with hooked bristles (Western Australian Herbarium 2007).\n\nWild Carrot differs from Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum) in having leaves with carroty smell when crushed; ribbed stem, normally with many short hairs 1-2 mm long, and just green in colour; umbels with dark flowers in the centre (normally), whereas Poison Hemlock has; unpleasant-smelling foliage; stem without ribs, hairless, and green with purple blotches; and flowers all one colour.\n\nFennel (Foeniculum vulgare) has a similar habit but narrower leaf segments than Wild Carrot, and foliage that smells of aniseed when crushed, and yellow flowers, not white or cream to light yellow like Wild Carrot.",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "English Broom is a Weed of National Significance (WONS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nAgriculture: Although seedlings apparently do not readily establish in ‘improved’ pasture, in non-‘improved’ grazing areas, English Broom can prevent grazing, reduce the area available for grazing, and restrict access to water. Mature plants are relatively unpalatable to sheep and cattle, and in the United States the consumption of foliage by horses has resulted in digestive problems. The seeds are considered toxic to stock if eaten excessively (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Hosking et al. 2000; Muyt 2001; DPIW 2002).\n\nNative ecosystems: In Australia English Broom is mainly an environmental weed, and is highly invasive in the cooler, higher rainfall regions. The total area of infested in Australia is estimated currently as being over 200 000 hectares, and it is still spreading. It can have devastating impacts, and totally transforms invaded areas. It forms dense stands, which shade out the ground flora, and roadside infestations can also reduce drivers’ vision and increase road maintenance costs. It commonly establishes in disturbed margins of native vegetation, from where it invades less disturbed native vegetation. Infestations also provide shelter for pest animals such as pigs and horses, which in turn pose a threat to native biota. It has invaded disturbed areas in national parks which have been cleared of blackberry infestations.\n\nEnglish Broom has invaded numerous native vegetation types in all the states where it is naturalised. In South Australia it is a common weed in the Southern Lofty Ranges. The species poses a very high risk to native vegetation, and has invaded heathlands and heathy woodlands, lowland grasslands and grassy woodlands, dry sclerophyll forest, wet sclerophyll forest, and alpine and subalpine areas (Carr et al. 1992). It is considered as one of the major invasive threats to the alpine and subalpine areas. It is abundant in the Mitta Mitta River valley, and around Falls Creek in Victoria. In New South Wales extensive areas of native vegetation have become infested. In the Barrington Tops north of Newcastle, an estimated 10 000 hectares has been invaded, and it is also a serious problem in the Blue Mountains. A number of orchid species and a daisy shrub that occur in the Barrington Tops are at risk from invasion (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Sainty et al. 1998; Hosking et al. 2000; Muyt 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "In most situations, the most effective and long term control of English Broom will be an integrated weed management program (i.e. a combination of the above methods rather than by reliance on a single method) (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Sainty et al. 1998; Cochrane 2001; Muyt 2001; DPIW 2002).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides are useful for both initial treatment and following other control methods (NSW Weedwise 2018). The most appropriate applications are either foliar spray or cut stump methods (NSW Weedwise 2018). When applying foliar sprays ensure that the mixture is applied to the point of run-off over the whole plant, and use a penetrant or surfactant as directed on the herbicide label (NSW Weedwise 2018). More than one application is usually necessary to be a successful control method.\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual control: For isolated plants of English Broom hand weeding or hoeing is an option. In smaller incursions the cut and paint method can be applied. Bulldozing and then burning larger infestations of English Broom has been used, but this is best avoided unless there are resources for follow-up management. This is only a partial and temporary solution, as this method creates extensive soil disturbance which favours the germination of soil-stored seeds, which will continue to germinate for a number of years. There can be up to 20 000 seeds per square metre in the soil. The advantages are that the adult plants are killed, and the seeds are stimulated to germinate, thus quickening the process of waiting for seeds to germinate so they can be destroyed. Lack of follow-up management, such as spraying the seedlings with herbicide, only exacerbates the problem.\n\nGrazing: Sheep, goats and cattle eat English Broom, particularly younger seedlings, and may suppress the development of infestations. Large plants can be cut to provide stock with better grazing access (SA Natural Resources 2015).\n\nBiological control: English Broom also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. An international biocontrol program involving Australia, New Zealand and the United States has been underway since 1990 to introduce a number of natural enemies to control English Broom. Two biological control agents, the Twig Mining Moth, Leucoptera spartifoliella (Hubner) and the Broom Cud Psyllid, Arytainilla spartiophila (Forster) were released in the north west, west and south of Tasmania in spring 1996 but follow up surveys have indicated these agents have failed to establish (DPIW 2002).\n\nFor more detailed information on control refer to Parsons & Cuthbertson (1992), Cochrane (2001), Muyt (2001) and DPIW (2002).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",

    "similarSpecies": "English Broom is similar to White Spanish Broom (Cytisus multiflorus), but this species differs by having the branchlets rounded in cross-section and longitudinally ribbed, not more or less 5-angled in cross-section as in English Broom. English Broom usually has three leaflets over the whole plant, compared with three leaflets in the lower branches and a single leaflet in the upper branches for white Spanish Broom. The petals in white Spanish Broom are white, and 8-12 mm long, compared with the petals of English Broom which are 16-25 mm long, usually yellow, partly red or tinged mauve (Spencer 2002).\n\nOther species with which English Broom can be confused include C. x dallimorei Rolfe, and C. x praecox Bean. C. x dallimorei is a hybrid between white Spanish Broom and English Broom (seed parent). The leaf stalks in English Broom are up to 15 mm long, the sepals are hairless, and the flowers are 15-25 mm long, whereas the leaf stalks in C. x dallimorei are up to 25 mm long, the sepals are slightly hairy, and the flowers are up to 15 mm long.. The flowers in C. x dallimorei are also pink, with crimson lateral petals. Cytisus x praecox is a hybrid between C. multiflorus and C. purgans. It differs from English Broom in usually having a single leaflet, and a style which is shorter than the lower 2 united petals (Spencer 2002).",

    "habitat": "In south-western Europe, where White Spanish Broom is native, it grows in the woods, heaths and river banks (Tutin et al. 1968). The Mediterranean climate from where it originates, makes it well adapted to the climate in southern Australia. In the United Kingdom, where it is naturalised in northern Wales and southern England, it grows on banks of roads and railways (Stace 1997). In New Zealand it is naturalised on the North Island, and it grows in dry waste places, scrubland, and riverbeds (Webb et al. 1988).\n\nAs a weed, it is known to enter relatively undisturbed bushland. In Australia, it has spread from lakeside plantings into roadsides and townships, but it could also establish in a wide range of disturbed and undisturbed habitats such as grasslands and open eucalypt woodlands (CRC 2003)\n\nWhite Spanish Broom was first collected from along a watercourse. The current main incursion in Victoria is beside St Georges Lake, with records from the National Herbarium of Victoria noting its original occurrence at this site along the spillway embankment. Contemporary collections in the National Herbarium of Victoria note that it is naturalised in weed invaded Eucalyptus forest on Ordovician deposits (Stajsic 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "White Spanish Broom is on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 non-native plants that threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage. Although only in the early stages of establishment, these weeds have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: While its main threat currently is as an environmental weed, reducing native biodiversity and landscape aesthetics, it has the potential to invade pasture and forestry (CRC 2003). Currently there are no reported cases of impact on livestock in Australia. Blood (2001) cites White Spanish Broom as being poisonous. The seeds of the related species Scotch broom are poisonous if ingested in quantity, and the foliage may cause digestive problems in horses (Blood 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: White Spanish Broom is closely related to Scotch Broom which is an highly invasive species in the cooler, higher rainfall areas of south-eastern Australia and has become widely naturalised in many regions. More than 200 000 hectares of land in eastern Australia has become infested with Scotch broom, and despite attempts to control it, it continues to spread (CRC 2003). White Broom has the same potential to become a highly invasive weed in natural areas of Australia.",
    "controlMethods": "Early detection and eradication are crucial. Small infestations can be eradicated if caught early enough. It is highly recommended that any new outbreaks should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Do not try to control White Spanish Broom without their expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nThere is relatively little information about the control of White Spanish Broom. Given that it is closely related to Scotch broom, the control methods applied to this species can be used to control or eradicate White Spanish Broom.\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual control: Hand weeding or hoeing is an option for where there are only isolated plants. In smaller incursions the cut and paint method can be applied. Bulldozing and then burning larger infestations of Scotch broom has been used (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992), but this is best avoided unless there are resources for follow-up management (Muyt, 2001).

The advantages are that the adult plants are killed, and the seeds are stimulated to germinate, thus quickening the process of waiting for seeds to germinate so they can be destroyed (Cochrane 2001).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides offer control of broom, especially in preventing spread from small isolated patches (NSW Weedwise 2018), however, there are no registered herbicides for White Spanish Broom (CRC 2003).\n\nFor more detailed information on control refer to:\n\nhttp://www.weeds.crc.org.au/documents/wmg_white_spanish_broom.pdf).",

However, C. x dallimorei has three leaflets throughout and pink and crimson flowers while C. x praecox differs from White Spanish Broom in having shortly stalked leaflets (stalkless in white Spanish boom), all the leaves have three leaflets, and the corolla can be white, yellow, pink or red (Spencer 2002).\n\nWhite Spanish Broom may also be confused with some other genera in the tribe Genistae, the group which is at the centre of taxonomic difficulties in delimiting the genera. One of the genera which may cause confusion in the determination is Retama. Retama differs from White Spanish Broom in producing short inflorescences arising from the main branchlets (axils), with 4-15 flowers on short axes. The pods are hairless (Stajsic 2007, pers. comm.). The pods in Retama are inflated and do not release their seeds explosively unlike both White Spanish Broom and Scotch broom (Jafri & El-Gadi 1980; Cullen et al. 1995).",

    "similarSpecies": "Yellow Nutgrass is closely related to introduced Nutgrass (Cyperus rotundus) and the native species C. bifax and C. victoriensis. It can be distinguished from all of them by its yellowish to dark golden brown flowers heads (red-brown to dark purplish brown in the other species), the usually hairy branches in its inflorescence (not hairy in the other species), its yellowish brown rhizomes (purplish to dark brown in the other species) and its round to egg-shaped 'nuts' that have a minutely hairy grey covering when mature (more or less oval and fibrous, but not hairy, in the other species). It usually prefers cooler regions than C. rotundus, but they can be found growing together in coastal New South Wales (Blake 1942; Auld & Medd 1992; Wilson 1993; European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization 2008; Wilson 2007 pers. comm.).",

It favours open, usually dry habitats (Kovander 1972) and is well suited to disturbed sites such as roadsides and sand dunes (CRC 2003). In Australia, it has been recorded growing in pasture and other weed dominated vegetation near Eden in New South Wales. In North America, the closely related Hound's Tongue (Cynoglossum officinale) is successful as a weed in habitats disturbed by logging, grazing and other activities (CRC 2003).",

    "impact": "Blue Hound's Tongue is on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 non-native plants that threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage. Although only in the early stages of establishment, these weeds have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: Blue Hound's Tongue contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that can be toxic to livestock. Poisoning may occur when stock are fed hay or chopped forage containing the plant. It has the potential to become troublesome in Australian pastures and grasslands by competing with established communities and hindering regeneration and establishment (Richardson et al. 2006; CRC 2003). The burrs of Blue Hound's Tongue can attach to livestock and may cause irritation and taint wool (CRC 2003).\n\nNative ecosystems: The severe impacts recorded overseas by the related species, Hound's Tongue (Cynoglossum officinale), suggest that Blue Hound's Tongue could become a major problem in Australia. In Canada, Hound's Tongue has become a major economic problem, with logged forests providing an ideal habitat for seedling establishment. Other factors, such as seed dispersal by livestock, a favourable climate and a topography that hinders mechanical and chemical control, have helped the plant spread from a few sparsely scattered weeds in the 1960s to a current infestation of 2000 ha (CRC 2003).\n\nAnother closely related species, Cynoglossum coeruleum, is also considered a weed and its importation into Australia is banned by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (CRC 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Early detection and eradication are crucial. Small infestations can be eradicated if caught early enough. It is highly recommended that any new outbreaks should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Do not try to control Blue Hound's Tongue without their expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nNon-chemical control: Crop management: Maintaining a competitive pasture will help reduce the opportunities for undesirable plants to invade. Paddocks infested with Blue Hound's Tongue should not be used for livestock during and after flowering in order to prevent the spread of seed. Additionally, where cattle come in contact with Blue Hound's Tongue, they must be thoroughly inspected and cleaned before being transported or moved to new areas (CRC 2003).\n\nOnce the initial infestations are controlled, follow-up monitoring and control will be required to ensure that reinfestation does not occur.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",

Australian Hound's Tongue differs from Blue Hound's Tongue by having smaller light blue to white coloured flowers and by having burrs with a flattened rim.

It prefers black basalt soils in Victoria and red-brown earth in South Australia (Parsons and Cuthbertson 2001; Navie 2004). It commonly infests pastures, but is also a weed of crops, grasslands, open woodlands, roadsides, gardens and disturbed sites (Navie 2004).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Artichoke Thistle (Cynara cardunculus) is largely known as a pest of agricultural areas (particularly pastures), and a weed of crops and disturbed sites. It invades natural habitats most commonly in grasslands, open woodlands, as well as roadsides, gardens, waste areas and disturbed sites. It can easily dominate the vegetation in densely infested areas, smothering most desirable ground-dwelling plants.\n\nAgriculture: Artichoke Thistle is a serious weed of  permanent pastures, and occasionally Lucerne. Once established, it dominates the vegetation of an area, out competing and smothering most desirable pasture species drawing most moisture and nutrients from the soil (Parsons and Cuthbertson 2001). The spiky nature of the plant deters grazing by stock and restricts their movement in dense infestations, but animals will eat the leaves when hungry and no other feed is available. It has low nutrient value and may cause stomach impaction and mechanical injuries, but is not poisonous (Government of South Australia 2014).\n\nNative ecosystems: Artichoke Thistle can invades natural habitats,  for example, grasslands, open woodlands, and wetlands and riparian areas in drier regions, smothering native ground-dwelling plants. In Victoria, it invades lowland grassland and grassy woodland, and riparian vegetation (Carr et al. 1992).\n\nUrban areas: Can invade disturbed sites and gardens, and is reported to cause dermatitis in some people.",
    "controlMethods": "Artichoke Thistle (Cynara cardunculus) can be controlled by herbicides, and young plants may be removed by physical means, with cultural and grazing by goats also an option.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can effectively kill Artichoke Thistle and should be applied from September to November while the plant is still in rosette or in early flower-head stage (Parsons and Cuthbertson 2001) Spot or boom spraying is only effective during autumn and winter and usually has to be undertaken twice. Use chemicals that are registered for Artichoke Thistle and use according to the label.  Also see DiTomaso, et al. (2013); DPI NSW (2019); Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA. (2018).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nPhysical control: Artichoke Thistle can be removed by physical grubbing when there are small infestations. Care must be taken to remove most of the tap root.\n\nCultural: Cultivation can also be effective, but new growth will appear from seeds and roots and the process must be repeated until no new growth appears. This may take 2 or 3 years and the areas should be sown to pasture afterwards so that any remaining seedlings are suppressed by being out-competed (Parsons and Cuthbertson 2001). However, repeated cultivation may lead to soil erosion and the breaking down of soil structure (Williamson et al. 2007).\n\nGrazing: Grazing by goats can significantly reduce flowering and therefore restricts seed production (Parsons and Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Artichoke Thistle (Cynara cardunculus) can easily be confused with the commonly cultivated Globe Artichoke (Cynara cardunculus subsp. flavescens) [as Cynara scolymus]. The globe artichoke is a cultivar of Cynara cardunculus subsp. flavescens, bred for lack of spines and fleshy involucral bracts. It is propagated vegetatively and progeny derived from seed tend to revert to wild forms (Bean et al. 2014). Artichoke Thistle has broad flower-head bracts which are flattened and pointed, tapering to short, stout spines. Globe Artichoke also has broad, flat bracts, but they are not very pointed and are spineless.\n\nArtichoke Thistle is also somewhat similar to Variegated Thistle (Silybum marianum). Artichoke Thistle has broad flower-head bracts which are flattened and pointed, tapering to short, stout spines. The leaves of Variegated Thistle are variegated, whereas those of Artichoke Thistle and Globe Artichoke are greyish green. Variegated Thistle also has flower-head bracts with broad bases and curled upper parts ending in long, narrow spines (Navie 2004).\n\nArtichoke Thistle can also be confused with other 'thistles' such as Spear Thistle (Cirsium vulgare), Perennial Thistle (Cirsium arvense), the Slender Thistles (Carduus pycnocephalus and Carduus tenuiflorus), Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) [as Carduus nutans subsp. nutans], Scotch Thistle (Onopordum acanthium) and Illyrian Thistle (O. illyricum). However, these species can all be easily distinguished from Artichoke Thistle by their 'winged' stems (Navie 2004).",

It mainly attacks Lucerne, Clovers and other legumes, but has also been recorded on Carrots, Onions and other species. Infested areas are often quarantined, causing considerable financial loss, and contaminated produce has a reduced value (Parsons and Cuthbertson 2001; Cunningham et al. 2003).\n\nNative ecosystems: Fringed Dodder also has the potential to be an environmental weed as it is known to infest native vegetation in south-eastern South Australia and New South Wales (Cunningham et al. 2003). For example, it was recently recorded from Lignum (Duma florulenta, formerly Muehlenbeckia florulenta) thickets and gidgee (Acacia cambagei) woodlands in Culgoa National Park in the central north of New South Wales (Hunter 2005).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Like with all parasitic plants, prevention of introduction and spread is vital to the management of Fringed Dodder. This is best achieved with good quarantine measures.\n\nPhysical control: Contaminated pasture seeds, hay and grain can introduce the plant to unaffected properties or to clean areas, so any contaminated produce should be destroyed. Livestock and contaminated machinery can also spread the seed to new areas.\n\nMechanical control: Machinery should be cleaned before moving to other paddocks and stock grazing on areas known to be infested with Fringed Dodder should be kept in quarantine for at least two days before they are moved to Dodder-free pastures (Trounce et al. 1998).\n\nLand management: Crops or pastures that are severely infested (e.g., Lucerne and Clover) should be replaced or rotated with less susceptible or resistant crops or pastures where practical. Where crops or pastures are used in rotations to control Fringed Dodder, Lucerne or susceptible legumes should not be sown again for at least five years (Trounce et al. 1998).\n\nChemical control: Fringed Dodder can be controlled by cutting the host plant as close as possible to ground level and burning it. Contact herbicides can be used to rapidly desiccate the standing crop and destroy the Dodder plants. These herbicides act by quickly killing green plant material and also provide dry fuel for a fire (Cunningham et al. 2003, Trounce et al. 1998).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

In Australia, it is recorded growing on plants in gardens, lawns, on agricultural crops as well as native plants in natural vegetation. It has been found parasitising agricultural crops (such as canola and lupins) and native species including Goodenia (Goodeniaceae), Glischrocaryon (Haloragaceae) and number of native daisies (Asteraceae). Its potential host range is most likely significantly greater than it's current host range (Pratt 2002; Western Australia Herbarium 2007). Overseas records of host plants include Citrus (Rutaceae), Grapes (Vitaceae), many legumes (Fabaceae), solanaceous vegetables (Solanaceae), Chrysanthemum (Asteraceae) and Cucumber (Cucurbitaceae) (Pratt 2002).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: Small-seeded Dodder as with other Dodder (Cuscuta species), does not generally kill the host plant (Cudney 1992). However, infestation in commercial crops results in yield losses and may cause reduced crop marketability. There are reports from overseas of intestinal disorders and poisonings of livestock from ingestion of Dodders, but there is little firm evidence that this is a significant impact (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Holm et al. 1997). Although mostly palatable to livestock, infestations of Dodder do reduce the quality of pastures (Cudney 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems: In areas of native vegetation it has the potential to significantly impact of the biodiversity (Pratt 2002). Dodders have been reported to also transmit virus diseases in certain crops (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",
    "controlMethods": "Small-seeded Dodder, as with most Dodders (Cuscuta species), is a difficult weed to eradicate once it is present in an area.\n\nNon-chemical control: Prevention of introduction and spread is a vital part of control and management of the plant. Movement of contaminated agricultural products (including fodder and livestock) that can introduce the plant to unaffected areas should be avoided. Livestock that have been grazing in contaminated areas or fed contaminated fodder should be quarantine for a sufficient period for seed to pass from their system before movement into uncontaminated areas. Mechanical control: Machinery can also spread the seed to new areas. All equipment should be cleaned prior to leaving infested areas (Pratt 2002).\n\nLand management: In infected areas the containment and prevention of the development of a soil seed bank is an important aspect of managing dodder infestations. The selection of less susceptible or resistant crops and crop timing can be useful strategies in reducing seed production and further spread. Other management tools include burning, slashing, repeated tilling and herbicide treatments (pre-emergence and late season treatments (Pratt 2002).\n\nChemical control: The use of herbicides alone is frequently ineffective in the control of dodder species (Pratt 2002). An integrated approach including herbicide treatments has been considered beneficial in reducing soil seed bank of Large-seeded Dodder (Cuscuta indecora) in California (Cudney et al. 1992). There is a wide range of herbicides known to control Dodder species in a variety of crops, with varying levels of effectiveness (Pratt 2002).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "habitat": "Golden Dodder is a common and widespread weed that grows in a wide range of environmental conditions and on a wide variety of host plants. It is most commonly found growing on plants and other weeds in gardens, parks, along roadsides and along waterways. It is also a serious pest of crops and sown pastures (Navie 2004).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Golden Dodder was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Golden Dodder was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: Golden Dodder is largely known as a pest of crops, particularly of plants belonging to the daisy (Asteraceae) and legume (Fabaceae) plant families. Numerous commercial crops have been attacked in Australia including a wide range of different field crops, pasture legumes, vegetables and horticultural plants (e.g., Lucerne, Lupins, Tomato, Zucchini, Carrot, Celery, Onion and Lettuce). Crop yields can be significantly reduced, through the loss of nutrients from parasitism and through shading caused by the dense mass of stems that develops on heavily infested hosts. Infested areas may also need to be quarantined for several years before crops can be grown again (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Golden Dodder can also be a nuisance pest in nurseries and home gardens.\n\nNative ecosystems: This species also attacks a wide range of naturalised species and native plants growing in pastures, along roadsides and in natural areas (e.g. Noogoora Burr (Xanthium strumarium) [as Xanthium occidentale], Smartweeds, Persicaria spp. and Lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta)). It has been reported from grasslands, open woodlands, coastal vine thickets, riparian areas and wetlands. In fact, Golden Dodder is regarded as an environmental weed in some parts of Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. It is actively managed by community groups in Western Australia and was recently listed as a priority environmental weed in three Natural Resource Management regions. It is of particular concern as an environmental weed in inland wetland areas. For example, it frequently grows on plants along the margins of Willandra Creek and its lagoons in Willandra National Park in the Riverina region of southern New South Wales and is also seen as a threat to the natural integrity of the Lake Lalbert Wildlife Reserve in northern Victoria (Navie & Adkins 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Golden Dodder is a difficult weed to eradicate, or even manage effectively, because its seed can survive for long periods in the soil and it can commence seed production after only a few weeks of growth.\n\nNon-chemical control: Prevention of introduction and spread is vital and this is best done with good quarantine measures. Contaminated pasture seed is an important source of new infestations, so it is essential to only use certified pasture seeds. Contaminated hay and grain can also introduce Golden Dodder to properties or to clean areas, so any contaminated fodder should be destroyed. Livestock and contaminated machinery can also spread the seed to new areas. Machinery should be cleaned before moving to other paddocks and stock grazing on areas known to be infested with Golden Dodder should be kept in quarantine for at least two days before they are moved to Dodder-free pastures. Control of weeds that are the preferred hosts for Golden Dodder, such as Noogoora and Bathurst Burrs (Xanthium spp.) will also reduce its chance of spreading and prevent them from becoming sources of infestation (Trounce et al. 1998).\n\nPhysical control: Golden Dodder can be controlled by cutting the host plant as close as possible to ground level and burning it. Do not slash infested areas, as this will promote the spread of Dodder.\n\nLand management: Crops or pastures that are severely infested (e.g., Lucerne and Clover) should be replaced or rotated with less susceptible or resistant crops or pastures where practical. Less susceptible species include cereal crops (e.g., Wheat, Barley, Oats, Triticale and Cereal Rye), summer grain crops (e.g., Maize and Sorghum) and perennial pasture grasses. Where crops or pastures are used in rotations to control Golden Dodder, lucerne or susceptible legumes should not be sown again for at least five years (Trounce et al. 1998).\n\nEarly detection is necessary if Golden Dodder is to be controlled before seeding commences. Therefore, all workers on at risk or infested farms should be made aware of Golden Dodder and be able to identify it. Vigilance is also required after control measures have been taken, as it is easy to overlook the small threads starting to invade again. Threads as small as 5 cm can re-attach to the host crop and continue the infestation (Trounce et al. 1998).\n\nChemical control: Although no selective herbicides are available for use, contact herbicides can be used to rapidly desiccate the standing crop and destroy the Dodder plants. Contact herbicides act by quickly killing green plant material and do not harm crop roots or seeds below the soil surface. Where Golden Dodder infestations occur in non-crop areas, it can be eradicated by control with non-selective herbicides (Trounce et al. 1998).\n\nCheck with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for Golden Dodder control. Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",
    "origin": "The actual native range of Golden Dodder is obscure. It is thought to be native to North America (Canada, USA and Mexico) and parts of the Caribbean (i.e., the Bahamas, Cuba, Guadeloupe, Jamaica and Martinique). It is possibly also native to parts of South America (GRIN 2007).",

    "similarSpecies": "Golden Dodder is very similar to the other naturalised (i.e., Cuscuta planiflora, C. suaveolens and C. epithymum) and native (i.e., C. australis, C. chinensis, C. tasmanica and C. victoriana) Dodders. However, Golden Dodder's bright golden yellow or orange coloured stems easily distinguish it from C. planiflora, C. epithymum and C. victoriana, which usually have reddish or pinkish stems. It can also be distinguished from C. suaveolens and C. tasmanica by its dense flowers clusters, as both these species have loose flower clusters, with flowers borne on stalks 3–6 mm long (Navie 2004).\n\nAustralian Dodder (C. australis) is very difficult to distinguish from Golden Dodder, but its petals are usually blunt-tipped or rounded and are often held upright. Finally, unlike Golden Dodder, Chinese Dodder (C. chinensis) has capsules that are entirely hidden by its withered petals (Navie 2004).\n\nGolden Dodder is also superficially similar to the native Dodder Laurels (Cassytha spp.), which are also parasitic twiners. However, the Dodder laurels have flowers with three petals and three sepals (instead of five) and 6–9 stamens (versus 5 in Dodder), their stems are often hairy and greenish in colour, and they have fleshy one-seeded fruits (Navie 2004).",

    "habitat": "Rubber Vine is a weed of semi-arid, tropical and sub-tropical environments. It infests creek banks and other waterways (i.e., riparian zones), open woodlands, grasslands, closed forests, forest margins, pastures, roadsides, disturbed sites and waste areas. It prefers sites with ample moisture and low shrubs or trees to support its climbing stems (Navie 2007). Rubber Vine grows on all soil types and is currently restricted to areas receiving an annual rainfall between 400 and 1400 mm. Its seeds readily germinate on riverbanks and in other moist areas. The young plants rapidly grow over and smother other plants, often completely dominating the vegetation. It then spreads aggressively from the riverbank to adjoining open woodlands and/or pastures (CRC 2003).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Rubber Vine is a Weed of National Significance and is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. It grows rapidly and smothers other plants, often completely dominating the vegetation and spreading aggressively from waterways into adjoining open woodlands and pastures.\n\nRubber Vine has significant impacts on the pastoral industry and conservation areas in north-eastern Australia. Its main impact on pastoralism is the loss of grazing country, which in 1995 was estimated to cost the Queensland beef industry $18 million (CRC 2003). It is toxic to livestock and dense infestations replace productive species, rendering grazing country less productive or even useless. It also increases the costs of mustering and fencing.\n\nRubber Vine threatens waterways, woodlands and rainforests throughout north-eastern Australia, including significant conservation areas such as the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area and Cape York Peninsula. It is particularly invasive in riverine vegetation, and can potentially displace the plants and animals that inhabit riverbanks, thereby affecting the water quality of streams. The whole ecological integrity of the native vine thickets and riverine systems of northern Australia is under threat from Rubber Vine (CRC 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Biological, chemical, fire and mechanical methods are all used to control Rubber Vine. Check with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for Rubber Vine control.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides are effective in the control of Rubber Vine, but their use is expensive when large areas are to be controlled. The strategic use of a range of registered herbicides is an effective method of controlling isolated or outlying Rubber Vine plants. Foliar spraying the entire plant from the ground and aerial spraying are most effective on smaller plants. The basal bark and cut stump techniques are more labour intensive, but are much more effective on more mature plants. All of these techniques should only be conducted when Rubber Vine is actively growing and are also less effective if plants have been damaged by biological control agents (CRC 2003; Land Protection 2006).\n\nNon-chemical control: Fire can be an especially valuable and inexpensive part of an integrated Rubber Vine control program because it kills surface seeds, seedlings and adult plants. If there is sufficient fuel, Rubber Vine can be burnt whilst green with good success. In a fire research experiment west of Chillagoe in Queensland, 80% of the Rubber Vine was killed in an initial fire, with a follow-up burn one year later resulting in a 99% kill rate. The fuel load should be about 1500 kg per hectare and pasture may need to be spelled before burning to allow the fuel to accumulate to high enough levels (CRC 2003).\n\nBlade or disc ploughs and cutter bars provide reasonable control of Rubber Vine, but are most often used to penetrate very dense infestations to allow easier access, or to open up the canopy. Mechanical control is not suited to areas such as gullies and creeks because it can lead to erosion. Recent research has shown that the use of fire after biological control agents have already damaged the plants can be highly effective. However, control programs should be tailored to the location, size, intensity and age of each situation (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Two biological control agents have become widespread in Queensland, since their release in the early 1990s and they have had an impact on the vigour of Rubber Vine. Rubber Vine Rust (Maravalia cryptostegiae) forms on the underside of leaves and causes them to turn yellow and drop and rust is usually abundant during the wet season but is less active during the dry season. The other agent is the Rubber Vine Moth (Euclasta whalleyi), whose caterpillars feed on Rubber Vine leaves between March and October. Both agents, especially the rust, can cause significant damage, but their effectiveness varies according to climatic conditions (CRC 2003; Land Protection 2006).\n\nAlso see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nFor further information see the Rubber Vine Management Manual (available at https://www.weeds.org.au/WoNS/rubbervine/ )",

Purple Rubber Vine can be distinguished by its yellowish-green or whitish coloured leaf stalks, its darker pink or purplish flowers and its shorter fruit (less than 10 cm long) (Tomley 1998; Doak and Deveze 2004).\n\nAustralian Rubber Vine (Gymnanthera oblonga) also has a similar habit and grows in the same areas of northern Australia. However, it can be easily distinguished by its much smaller greenish-yellow flowers (less than 2 cm long) and narrower fruit that are only 5-6 mm wide (Doak and Deveze 2004; Navie 2007).",

    "impact": "Common Crupina (Crupina vulgaris) is one of seventeen sleeper weeds identified by the Bureau of Rural Sciences (following consultation with the Australian Weeds Committee) which could have nationally significant impacts on agriculture if allowed to spread. In the western United States Common Crupina is described as an aggressive competitor because of its climate and soil adaptability, high reproductive rate and efficient dispersal. In the 22 years since it was first detected it has spread to and infested over 25 000 hectares, sometimes forming nearly solid stands that exclude desirable plants\n\nAgriculture: Common Crupina could impact on grazing over significant areas of southern Australia. It invades rangeland, pastures, natural areas and waste places (Cunningham et al. 2004). Adapted to a wide range of soil and climate conditions, it can form solid stands, which decrease forage productivity and livestock carrying capacity. Although it is not toxic, livestock tend to avoid Common Crupina. The stem and leaf margins develop short, stiff hairs as the plant bolts. Therefore, it is only palatable to livestock in the rosette stage (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 1999).\n\nNative ecosystems: It may also compete with native grassland plants (DPIW 2006) and succeed in other types of open native and degraded vegetation. In the western United States it forms dense populations that invade grasslands, forested areas, canyons, riparian areas that displace native plants, and impair plant communities by reducing biodiversity.\n\nUrban areas: In the western United States it also forms dense populations on roadsides and waste areas.",
    "controlMethods": "Annual Common Crupina (Crupina vulgaris) can be controlled using mechanical, physical and herbicides. Whether using hand or herbicide treatments, follow up in subsequent years will be necessary to extend control beyond the soil seed dormancy period (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 1999). Plants should be removed every 3 to 4 weeks during the spring to ensure complete removal prior to seed maturity.\n\nChemical control: Standard herbicides are likely to be effective against Common Crupina. Please check the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Since Common Crupina is an annual plant, hand-pulling or hoeing before flowering can be effective.  However, this method requires many visits to find all plants.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation and tillage operations commonly used for annual cropping systems. It is easily pulled by hand, a method practical only for small infestations. for effective eradication, sites must be inspected for at least 3 years after the last year of seed production to ensure that no seeds or plants have escaped (Thill et al., 1999).\nCompetition and management: Prevent establishment via competition with pasture or crop plants as Common Crupina is not strongly competitive in situations where it is shaded by taller plants. Most livestock avoid grazing Common Crupina unless palatable forage is unavailable. However, it is highly favoured by sheep and goats in the Mediterranean region.",

It forms dense thickets that can impede movement of stock and humans.\n\nNative ecosystems: Azzarola can spread away from plantings during favorable conditions into native grasslands, woodlands, forest areas, and poorly managed pastures. These dense patches can also provide cover for pest animals such as rabbits (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Azarola can have a major impact on bushland habitats, shading out ground-flora and affecting the growth and regeneration of overstorey plants. It is likely that the leaves dropped each autumn impact on biodiversity by increasing nutrients levels in surface soil. Dense patches compete with native regrowth and form spiny thickets that provide good cover for rabbits and other pests (Government of South Australia 2021). In the Adelaide Foothills, Azzarola together with introduced Olives have invaded many hectares across a hillside at Mount Osmond Reserve, between Waterfall Gully road and the Lookout with little to no native vegetation remaining.\n\nAgriculture: It can form dense stands that reduce grazing capacity of stock due to exclusion and as the spines act as a deterrent. Due to the presence of hydrocyanic acid in some Crataegus species, Hawthorn is potentially hazardous to grazing stock (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In the British Isles, Crataegus species are an important reservoir of the fire blight bacterium which affects pears and apples.

Hawthorn can be a reservoir for the fire blight bacterium that affects apple and pear crops (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001), and can host light-brown apple moth (Holding & Bowcher 2007). Dense patches of may provide good cover for rabbits and other pests. In the British Isles, May and other hawthorns are an important reservoir of the fire blight bacterium, which affects pears and apples. May also is known to host Mediterranean fruit fly and light brown apple moth (Government of South Australia 2021).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Hawthorn seedlings can be controlled by pulling or grubbing (Robertson 2006). Larger plants can also be removed mechanically, but regrowth can occur unless the entire crown and the top few centimetres of root are removed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) so chemical treatment helps  kill plants.\n\nChemical control: The trunks of large plants can be drilled and filled with herbicide, or can be cut near the ground and the base painted or swabbed with herbicide. Overall spraying of Hawthorn plants is not reliable (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Robertson 2006), but small plants are susceptible to spot spraying.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "Hawthorn has a very wide native range in western Europe, the Mediterranean region, Asia Minor and Afghanistan (Parsons 1973; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is considered weedy in several countries including Australia, north-eastern United States, where it occurs widely (GRIN 2007; USDA 2007), and New Zealand, where it is occasional but widespread on the North and South Islands and Stewart Island (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Roy et al. 2004).",

Its young stems are covered in soft hairs (i.e. they are pubescent).\n\nThe American Hawthorns including; Crataegus crus-galli; Crataegus phaenopyrum. These are spiny plants but with spines 6–10 cm long with slightly bigger  scarlet red, fruit 6–15 mm across; always containing two hard 'seeds' (i.e. pyrenes).\n\nHawthorn is also similar to the Cotoneasters (Cotoneaster species.), but these species have leaves with entire margins, and do not have spines (Symon 1986). Hawthorn is also similar to the Firethorns (Pyracantha species). However, Firethorns have leaves with entire or finely toothed margins, and are not lobed (Navie 2004).",

The fruits of closely related Large-leaved Cotoneaster (Cotoneaster glaucophyllus) are poisonous and fruits of Himalayan Cotoneaster may also be poisonous if ingested by humans, stock, and [domestic] dogs.\n\nAgriculture: Not a problem in pastures but if stock have access to the plant can cause animal poisoning. The fruit may contain cyanogenic glycosides which turns to cyanide in the stomach. This can cause poisoning in some animals, especially ruminants e.g. cattle and sheep (DPI NSW 2019). This species may also act as a host for bacterial fireblight, a disease of orchards (Queensland Government 2016) and the species may also be susceptible to honey fungus and the beet aphid.\n\nNative ecosystems: Himalayan Cotoneaster can be a significant weed of native bushland areas, and can form the understorey in open woodlands and forest margins  forming dense thickets. It can displace native species and alter plant community composition through water, light, and space competition (Auckland Regional Council 2007). The abundant seedlings compete strongly with native plants, and with each other, due to their rapid growth and competitive root system (Sigg 2004). The berries may encourage and support pest bird species such as starlings, blackbirds and sparrows (Tamar Valley Weeds Strategy 2008).\n\nHuman impacts: As the fruits of the closely related species, Large-leaved Cotoneaster (Cotoneaster glaucophyllus) are  poisonous to humans (Navie 2004) and Himalayan Cotoneaster may poses similar effects on humans and animals. The fruit of Large-leaved Cotoneaster cause gastroenteritis, but a large quantity would need to be eaten to have this effect, especially by children and children have become violently ill after eating berries. The berries of also contain another unidentified toxin which causes vomiting and diarrhea in dogs (DPI NSW 2019; Herbiguide 2021).\n\nWhat to do if a person is poisoned:\n\nIf the patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nIf the patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",

Since seed germination can occur all year round, pulling of seedlings should be maintained throughout the year. The numerous seedlings compete vigorously with each other and therefore it may be more efficient to wait until most plants have been killed through sibling competition before pulling (Muyt 2001; Auckland Regional Council 2007). Frequent removal of shoots produced from the stump may be required (Sigg 2004). Cleared sites should be replanted quickly with dense, low growing native shrubs to help prevent seedling regrowth (Weedbusters 2004).\n\nChemical control: Larger plants can be cut close to the ground and treated with herbicide to prevent re-shooting, preferably in summer to autumn just after fruiting (Muyt 2001). Frequent removal of shoots produced from the stump may be required (Sigg 2004). Plants can also be treated with drill and fill/stem injection method in spring or early summer, before fruit mature in early autumn with drilled holes or cuts made into the sapwood and filled with herbicide within 15 seconds of making the cut (Muyt 2001). Cut stump method should be carried out just after fruiting in autumn with trunks/stems cut and herbicide applied to the stump within 15 seconds of cutting.

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Large-leaved Cotoneaster grows in urban bushland and along roadsides. It is poisonous to people, dogs and livestock, and forms dense thickets under trees shading out local native species (DPI NSW 2019). The fruits is considered poisonous if ingested by humans, stock, and [domestic] dogs.\n\nAgriculture: Not a problem in pastures but if stock have access to the plant can cause animal poisoning. The fruit contains cyanogenic glycosides which turns to cyanide in the stomach. This can cause poisoning in some animals, especially ruminants e.g. cattle and sheep (DPI NSW 2019). This species can also act as a host for bacterial fireblight, a disease of orchards (Queensland Government 2016) and the species is susceptible to honey fungus and the beet aphid.\n\nNative ecosystems: Large-leaved Cotoneaster produces abundant, highly viable seed that can be dispersed into native bushland or other native habitats. It grows vigorously and can form dense often in monocultures (stands composed of a single species), long lived stands that can displace native shrub species and prevent under-story and over-story growth and regeneration (Muyt 2001; Weedbusters 2004). This species is very tolerant to a range of environmental conditions, including damp, cold, saline and drought stressed environments, allowing it to be problematic in numerous areas (Sigg 2004; Weedbusters 2004).\n\nHuman impacts: The fruit of Large-leaved Cotoneaster are considered to be mildly toxic to poisonous to humans (Navie 2004). The fruit can cause gastroenteritis, but a large quantity would need to be eaten to have this effect, especially by children and children have become violently ill after eating berries The berries also contain another unidentified toxin which causes vomiting and diarrhea in dogs (DPI NSW 2019; Herbiguide 2021).\n\nWhat to do if a person is poisoned:\n\nIf the patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nIf the patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Smaller plants of Large-leaved Cotoneaster are easily removed by pulling. As seed germination can occur all year round, pulling of seedlings should be maintained throughout the year. The numerous seedlings compete vigorously with each other, therefore it may be more efficient to wait until most plant have been killed through sibling competition before pulling (Weedbusters 2004). Cleared sites should be replanted quickly with dense, low growing native shrubs to help prevent seedling regrowth (Weedbusters 2004). The carpet of seedlings that emerge, normally after removal of the mother plant(s) can be manually removed, smothered with mulch, or black plastic, or sprayed with herbicide.\n\nChemical control: Larger plants can be cut close to the ground and treated with herbicide to prevent re-shooting, preferably in summer-autumn just after fruiting (Muyt 2001). Frequent removal of shoots produced from the stump may be required (Sigg 2004). Plants can also be treated with drill and fill/stem injection method in spring or early summer, before fruit mature in early autumn with drilled holes or cuts made into the sapwood and filled with herbicide within 15 seconds of making the cut (Muyt 2001).  Cut stump method should be carried out just after fruiting in autumn with trunks/stems cut and  herbicide applied to the stump within 15 seconds of cutting. The carpets of seedlings cam be sprayed with herbicides, or larger plants with an application of foliar spray with penetrant.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "impact": "Pampas Grass was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Pampas Grass was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. Pampas grass is an environmental weed that out-competes native vegetation and also grows in disturbed sites, waste areas, forestry plantations and along roadsides. Due to its large size and abundance of biomass, it is a fire hazard, that can also provides cover for pest animal species.\n\nAgriculture: Tufted clumps of Pampas and Pink Pampas Grass are of greatest potential weed significance to forestry operations, but are not considered agricultural weeds, because young plants are readily grazed by stock and have no potential to establish in cropping systems. Once established, pampas grass is highly competitive, restricting the replanting of pines (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Pampas Grass has a number of invasive characteristics – rapid growth, large biomass accumulation, production of numerous seeds, and long distance seed dispersal (up to 30 kilometres). Once established, pampas grass is highly competitive, restricting the regeneration of native trees (Government of South Australia 2021), and can crowd out native plants, competing for light, water, nutrients and space (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Dense stands of Pampas Grass restrict access by native fauna, humans and stock, and create fire hazards (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). It has the potential to invade large areas of urban bushland (Starr et al. 2003; Great Lakes Council 2006) and can invade and negatively impact wetlands, swamps and stream banks, bushland, open woodlands, grasslands, and coastal environments. (DPI NSW 20219).",
    "controlMethods": "Pampas Grass and Pink Pampas Grass can be controlled by physical, mechanical, grazing and herbicides.\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical/manual removal of Pampas Grass is the best method of control where possible and should be carried out when the soil is moist, normally after rain. Remove plants when they are small. Make sure to remove all the crown and root system, which spreads out from the plants. Wear long sleeves and gloves as protection from the sharp leaves. Medium sized plants can be dug out taking care to remove all the crown roots and follow-up within 3 to 6 months or when regrowth is visible if following up with a chemical treatment. It is usually easier and safer to slash back the sharp leaves first. If plants are flowering, remove flower heads carefully, placing them in a sealed plastic bag for disposal to prevent further spread of the seed (Anon. undated; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Large plants can be removed by machine. Seed heads should be removed first and placed in a plastic bag for disposal. Slash the plant and dig out the crown and roots.\n\nGrazing while pampas plants are young (stock avoid it once mature) is effective and follow up with another control method may be required. Grazing can prevent flowers from developing and setting seed. Only graze where the risk of causing new infestations is low.\n\nChemical control: A number of chemicals (herbicides) are available for the treatment of Pampas Grass as an alternative and useful follow-up to mechanical/manual methods. Foliar spray is the only practical application method.\n\nPlease see Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018); DPI NSW (2019); the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Field Bindweed will grow in a wide range of soil conditions but does best on deep, fertile, alkaline, heavier textured soils (Holm et al. 1977; Johnson 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It prefers moderately moist soils but will tolerate drier soils conditions. Field Bindweed is intolerant of extended periods of waterlogged soil conditions (Holm et al. 1977; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: Field Bindweed is a troublesome vine of agricultural fields throughout temperate regions of the world. It is an excellent competitor for soil moisture and can significantly reduce harvest yields in agricultural crops, and kill establishing trees and vines in orchards and vineyards. Additionally, the plant twines over crops, weighing them down, and interferes with harvesting (Holm et al. 1977; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Field Bindweed can also harbour pests and diseases which can spread to and affect a number of agricultural crops (Holm et al. 1977; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Field Bindweed has little or no feed value for stock and may make stock vomit, and is suspected of causing intestinal problems in horses and pigs, and photosensitisation in susceptible animals (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; California Department of Food and Agriculture 2008).\n\nNative ecosystems: It is invasive of native vegetation in riparian zones (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "Field Bindweed is a difficult weed to eradicate once established due to regeneration from rhizomes (underground stems) and long-lived seeds. It is not as important a problem in native vegetation as it is in agricultural areas. Only seedlings and young plants are susceptible to herbicides.\n\nPrevention: Prevention of introduction and spread is a vital part of control and management of the plant. Once plants are established an effective control program should prevent seed production, kill roots and root buds, and prevent infestation by seedlings from the persistent soil seed bank. The area also must be managed in such a way that prevents the further spread of seed or plant parts to unaffected areas.\n\nChemical control: Seedlings and young plants are fairly susceptible to herbicides, however well established plants are able to regenerate from the extensive root system. Herbicide control of Field Bindweed generally requires multiple chemicals and repeated applications (Holm et al. 1977; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Zollinger & Lym 2000). In the United States of America, some strains of Field Bindweed have become resistant to some herbicides (Pheloung et al. 1999).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nIt is suggested that the best control of Field Bindweed is an integrated approach including a combination of tillage, herbicides treatments and competitive crops (Holm et al. 1977; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Zollinger & Lym 2000). Other management tools include flooding and biological control agents. Field Bindweed is killed when covered to a depth of 15 to 25 cm with water for 60 to 90 days (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nBiological control: There are a number of biological agents in use or being evaluated in North America (California Department of Food and Agriculture (2008). However, there are currently no registered biological control agents for Field Bindweed in Australia and the species is not a Target for Biological Control in Australia.",

However their flowers are smaller (Johnson 2001).\n\nField Bindweed may also be confused with some native Polymerias. Polymeria pusilla has small, relatively broad leaves, often with lobed bases, and pink flowers. Polymeria calycina has broad to relatively elongated leave, also often with lobed bases. They both have sepals (leaf like structures at the base of the flower) with pointed tips and which tend to enclose the fruit, unlike in Field Bindweed.\n\nGreater Bindweed (Calystegia sepium) also has arrowhead-shaped leaves but large flowers (30-60 mm across) that are usually white and only occasionally slightly pink in colour. The base of the flower has two large leafy bracts (15-20 mm long) which are not present in Field Bindweed.\n\nCowvine (Ipomoea lonchophylla) and common morning glory (Ipomoea purpurea) have different shaped leaves and smaller flowers. Cowvine has relatively elongated leaves, with slightly heart-shaped (i.e. cordate) bases, and small white flowers less than 20 mm across. Common Morning Glory has large, broad, heart-shaped or three-lobed leaves and large flowers (30-60 mm across) that are white, pink, red, purple or bluish-purple in colour.\n\nClimbing Buckwheat (Fallopia convolvulus) also has arrow-shaped leaves but much smaller, inconspicuous, flowers (less than 5 mm across) that are whitish or greenish in colour.

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Hemlock is a significant weed because all parts of the plant are poisonous to humans and livestock. If eaten it will cause death by respiratory paralysis. The content of toxic alkaloids varies with climatic conditions and are presumed to be destroyed after heating. The seed and young plants are more toxic that other parts of the plant.\n\nAgriculture: Cattle and pigs appear to be more susceptible than sheep and goats and young animals are more susceptible than old. Handling the plant may cause dermatitis in some people. Hemlock taints milk and can affect yield, and if consumed in sub-lethal doses, may cause birth deformities in unborn cattle and pigs. It is rarely eaten green by stock, but may be consumed when accidentally incorporated into hay or silage. Symptoms of poisoning in stock are loss of muscular power, stumbling and falling, salivation, nausea, dilation of pupils and convulsions. The symptoms usually occur within 1 hour of consuming the plant and death follows 2-3 hours later (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Once established Hemlock can preclude the growth of other plants and reduce the grazing value of and area (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Hemlock is capable of rapidly establishing after rain particularly in disturbed or riparian sites or in areas where little vegetation occurs as a result of seasonal rainfall patterns, and can replace many native species.\n\nUrban areas: Hemlock will establish in urban riparian areas replacing desired species and can lead to human poisonings if consumed.\n\nIn humans it is capable of causing serious illness or death, and all parts of the plant are poisonous when ingested. Symptoms include nervousness, trembling and then respiratory distress. If poisoning occurs and:\n\nthe patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nthe patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",
    "controlMethods": "Hemlock needs a long term management plan with different methods used in combination to achieve successful removal of an infestation (Williamson et al. 2007).\n\nChemical control: Chemical control should be carried out before flowering. Spot spraying is more effective than boom or mist spraying. Plants treated with some herbicides may become attractive to stock and special care should be taken to keep animals away from treated areas (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) as it is highly toxic to animals and humans and is capable of causing serious illness or death.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control Individual plants of Hemlock should be hand pulled or hoed and large areas cultivated before plants flower. If pulling pants by hand gloves should be worn to protect against a reaction to the toxins in the plant. Follow up cultivation will be necessary to deal with seedlings. Mowing or slashing before flowering is useful but the bases of the plants may re sprout (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nCompetition and management: In grazed areas vigorous pasture should be sown to inhibit seedling growth. As Hemlock is highly toxic, capable of causing serious illness or death to all domestic animals (and humans), grazing should always be avoided. No biological control is available for Hemlock.",

    "habitat": "Spear Thistle is found in subhumid to cool temperate areas of temperate and subtropical Australia from the coast to subalpine regions but only ever sporadically in drier, more inland areas. In tropical north-eastern Australia it is limited to upland areas (altitudes over 800 m). In southern Australia it is abundant being favoured by the Mediterranean climate with rainfall 500–900 mm per year, fertile soils and open sunny sites. It is found in pastures (including irrigated pastures), cropland (including irrigated crops), on roadsides and neglected areas, but is also known to occur on less fertile coastal dunes and in heathlands. In areas of natural vegetation it is invasive, but usually where there has been some disturbance (Parsons & Cutherbertson 1992; Slee 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Spear Thistle (Cirsium vulgare) is mainly a weed of agricultural areas, wasteland, roadsides, open native vegetation and disturbed areas. It competes with sown and desirable species.\n\nAgriculture: Spear Thistle has a high impact in pastures because of the size, spininess and the competitive ability of the plants for moisture and nutrients. The plants physically deter stock from grazing, out compete valuable pasture plants, reduce carrying capacity, may provide harbour for vermin such as rabbits and can contaminate hay (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; DPIW 2002). In addition the spines contaminate wool making shearing difficult and degrading the value of the clip (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; DPIW 2002). Spear Thistle spines may transmit virus diseases between animals.\n\nIt is valuable to the honey industry as it produces a good supply of nectar and pollen (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems: In areas of natural vegetation it is invasive, but usually where there has been some disturbance (Parsons & Cutherbertson 1992; Slee 2007, pers. comm.). It invades disturbed native grasslands, open woodlands and conservation areas.\n\nUrban areas: A weed of gardens and urban parks, roadsides and neglected sites.",
    "controlMethods": "Spear Thistle (Cirsium vulgare) is mainly controlled by herbicide application and can be managed by cultivation. Not eaten by cattle or sheep, but eaten by goats. In pastures, the most effective form of control is maintenance of a healthy perennial pasture at all seasons, but particularly in summer going into autumn when the weed mostly germinates.\n\nChemical control: Spear Thistles at the seedling stage are susceptible to growth regulator type herbicides. When practicable, spraying should be completed before the centre flowering stem develops. Although Spear Thistle remains reasonably susceptible even up to flowering, treatment at this late stage involves the use of more active forms of the herbicides and of higher application rates, with a consequent risk of greater pasture legume damage (DPIW 2002).\n\nIn years when there is an early autumn break and large numbers of thistles germinate before the temperature falls, autumn spraying can be very effective. Spraying at this time also requires lower herbicide rates, is less damaging to clover and allows the desirable pasture species to grow with reduced competition from the thistles (DPIW 2002).\n\nIn most winters when the temperature falls to near freezing, Spear Thistles become dormant and very much less susceptible to herbicides. Susceptibility increases again with the onset of spring growth and spraying can usually be resumed effectively in September or October (DPIW 2002).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Single or small population can be chipped out by hand, removing most of the roots.\n\nMechanical control: For existing infestations cultivation of the infested area while plants are rosettes is effective provided follow-up cultivation of new seedlings and any regrowth occurs. Re-sowing of perennial pasture will reduce the chance of re-infestation. Management of grazing during autumn to reduce grazing pressure will also assist the pasture to remain vigorous (DPIW 2002).\nCompetition and management: The best means of control of Spear Thistle is to establish a well maintained perennial pasture. This will reduce the likelihood of new infestations establishing (DPIW 2002). For existing infestations cultivation of the infested area while plants are rosettes is effective provided follow-up cultivation of new seedlings and any regrowth occurs. Re-sowing of perennial pasture will reduce the chance of re-infestation. Management of grazing during autumn to reduce grazing pressure will also assist the pasture to remain vigorous (DPIW 2002).\nWhile Spear Thistles are not normally grazed by cattle or sheep, goats will graze Spear Thistles at the flowering stage, eating flowers, seed heads and stems. Over a period of several seasons this prevention of seed production can produce a significant reduction in Thistle numbers (DPIW 2002).\nBiological control: Spear Thistle has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. A research program into possible biological control agents has been undertaken in Victoria, focused on the Spear Thistle Gall Fly (Urophora stylata) and a thistle receptacle Weevil (Rhinocyllusconicus). It is hoped these will reduce seed production in the field (Keith Turnbull Institute 1998).",

In addition Perennial Thistle also has much smaller flower heads with male flowers and female flowers occurring on separate plants, compared with Spear Thistle's larger bisexual flowerheads. Perennial Thistle does not have 'wings' along the stems and has short, purple tipped spines on the floral bracts (Navie 2004; Slee 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nSpear Thistle can easily be told from Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) by its erect flower head (drooping heads in Carduus nutans) and the greenish coloured, spine-tipped bracts. Nodding Thistle has dropping flowerheads and purplish coloured bracts (Navie 2004).\n\nSpear Thistle may also be confused with the Slender Thistles (Carduus pycnocephalus and C. tenuiflorus). However, these have smaller, slender stalkless (sessile) flowerheads compared with the large, broad, stalked (petiolate) flower heads of Spear Thistle (Navie 2004).",

    "habitat": "Perennial Thistle is a species of cold to warm temperate areas with rainfall or more than about 700 mm per year, with fertile deep loamy soils, and plenty of sunshine. It occurs from sea level to subalpine areas. It can tolerate heavy frosts and likes soils high in nitrogen. Open areas are preferred for initial establishment, and the species is generally found in pastures, crops, roadsides and neglected areas (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Perennial Thistle (Cirsium arvense) impacts on agricultural production, especially in degrading valuable grazing land on normally productive fertile soils. Its persistent root system and perennial habit make it particularly troublesome (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Perennial thistle colonise disturbed areas. Perennial thistle forms large colonies with dense growth crowding out desirable plants. It is a weed of pastures, crops, roadsides and wasteland in higher rainfall areas.\n\nAgriculture: Perennial Thistle competes with crops such as potatoes, asparagus and peas and can interfere with harvesting. The flower buds are similar in shape, size and texture to shelled peas creating problems in mechanically harvested pea crops (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). The spiny plants can form dense swards of stems to 2 m tall impeding movement of stock and humans. If grazed it can cause mouth ulceration in sheep (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; DAF undated). Once established on a bare area Perennial Thistle can shade out desirable species, or prevent growth of desirable species by allelopathic effects (which inhibit the growth of other species) on adjacent pasture plants. It can invade native grasslands through establishment on disturbed bare areas (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). It harbours insects that attack commercial crops and is an alternate host for certain plant pathogens (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems: Not widely known from native vegetation.\n\nUrban areas: Potentially problematic in gardens, roadsides, and urban situations.",
    "controlMethods": "For Perennial Thistle (Cirsium arvense), as with all thistles the best means of control is to prevent initial establishment. With Perennial Thistle this means maintaining good quality pasture free from bare areas as germination is always more successful on open sites. Once an infestation is established control is problematic because of the rhizomatous nature of the plant. An integrated approach using a combination of strategies is likely to be the most effective (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nChemical control: Although the top growth Perennial Thistle is susceptible to many herbicides, long term control is difficult to obtain, as it is with most deep rooted perennials. Herbicide applications can be effective if the right herbicide is chosen and applied at the right time. As with other thistle species, seedlings are the most susceptible growth stage and provided the plants are growing vigorously, treatment should be applied as soon as germination is complete. Care should be taken to differentiate between seedlings and rosettes that have regrown from root stock as the response to control methods are different. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-Chemical control:  Cultivation of infested areas is not advised because this fragments the rhizome and can seriously spread the problem by moving roots with vegetative buds to new areas. The only exception to this is if the ground can be repeatedly cultivated every couple of weeks to totally prevent emergence of any shoots until the root system is exhausted. It is though that over about a year the root system will die. However, it generally at least two to three years are required. In the mean time the land is out of production and this method could also contribute to soil erosion and a breakdown of the soil structure (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Pasture species which grow actively in summer, such as lucerne and phalaris, are good competitors and can out-compete Perennial Thistle especially when combined with regular mowing (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Parsons & Cuthbertson (1992) also comment that studies in New Zealand have suggested that goat grazing can be very damaging to Perennial Thistle.\n\nBiological Control: Perennial Thistle has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. However, Biological control involving a rust fungus and Puccinia punictiformis and native aphids have been known to restrict its spread but do not offer long term control (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nFor further information on control and management of Perennial Thistle see: DiTomaso &  Kyser (2013); DPI NSW (2020) and DPIRD (2020);  Parsons & Cuthbertson (1992); TPIPWE (2019).",
    "origin": "Perennial Thistle is native in Europe, western Asia (i.e. Eurasia) and northern Africa (Navie 2004; GRIN 2007).

Perennial Thistle also lacks wings on the stems (Navie 2004; Slee 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nThe Slender Thistles (Carduus pycnocephalus and Carduus tenuiflorus) and Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) may also be confused with Perennial Thistle.

    "impact": "Native ecosystems: An aggressive species, Camphor Laurel is capable of dominating many habitats. Its wide canopy and extensive roots system eliminate virtually all other vegetation under the canopy. This, along with its shallow root system, promotes soil erosion, particularly along stream banks. Nevertheless, the berries have also become an important food source for native birds, which play a vital role in the distribution of seeds (NCWAC 2003). Camphor is obtained from the tree by distillation and the timber is used for clothes storage boxes and woodwork (Harden 2007).\n\nAgriculture: Recent studies have shown its fruit, seeds, leaves, roots and bark to be toxic to aquatic life, such as tadpoles, fish fingerlings and invertebrates. It is a weed of dairy farms and other agricultural lands, taking over pastures and pushing over fences. It is known to discolour milk if cows are allowed to graze the foliage. Older trees develop extensive root systems which can block drains (Muyt 2001; TSSC 2003; NCWAC 2003; Land Protection 2006).",

    "habitat": "Bitou Bush grows in a range of environments – from open exposed dunes to shaded forests. It is tolerant of shade, salinity, strong wind, windblown sand and water, drought, low nutrients and, to some extent, disturbances such as fire. It grows poorly in wet or swampy soils and has a low tolerance to frost (CRC 2003). Bitou bush occurs on a range of soil types but the majority of infestations are found on sandy or medium-textured, low fertility soils. It is unlikely to grow in constantly wet or inundated soils, however, it can grow on the edges of estuaries and mangroves, and damp margins of coastal dune ‘swale’ lakes and lagoons. It prefers disturbed areas, particularly near the sea, where it tolerates saline conditions. The optimal temperature for growth is between 17 and 27°C and plants have a low tolerance for frost (Howden 1984: In Winkler et al. 2008).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Bitou Bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata) is a Weed of National Significance and is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts (CRC 2003). Without effective control programs, Bitou Bush has the potential to become more abundant within its current range and to spread into new areas.\n\nAgriculture: Bitou Bush is not an agricultural weed and does not persist when grazed and trampled by stock, nor when land is cultivated.\nNative ecosystems: Bitou Bush is an aggressive weed in coastal dune vegetation where it can out-compete, and in many cases totally eliminate, the native flora. The invasive success of Bitou Bush is due to its vigorous growth and prolific seed production. Bitou Bush grows faster than many native plants and is free of pests and diseases giving it a competitive advantage over natives. It forms a dense green thicket which can prevent native seedlings from growing. When it forms such dense stands, it can destroy, or drastically alter, the habitat of many native birds and animals as well (Winkler et al. 2008).\nBitou Bush forms dense shrub layers which can obscure entire sand dunes and change views of headlands and beaches. The most important impact of Bitou Bush is reduction of coastal biodiversity in infested areas. Bitou Bush affects a number of threatened species and plant communities, particularly in the Sydney region. Over 150 native plant species, three endangered plant populations and 24 ecological communities are under threat from Bitou Bush invasion in New South Wales alone.\nThere is evidence to suggest Bitou Bush invasion can result in the decline of some native bird populations. However, other bird species have been found to increase in abundance when Bitou Bush is present. Birds that forage almost exclusively on plant material, scavengers and raptors show lower abundances and species richness in weed-infested habitats (French & Zubovic 1997). A number of bat species and the Squirrel Glider are also suspected of being threatened by Bitou Bush invasion. However, the lack of research in this area makes this difficult to prove at this stage (Winkler et al. 2008).\nBitou Bush can also create a favourable environment for other highly invasive weeds, such as Asparagus Fern, Lantana and Glory Lily (CRC 2003). The higher soil nitrogen beneath the weed infestations could increase the competitive superiority of Bitou Bush directly by increasing growth rate, or indirectly by hampering the establishment of native species that are adapted to growing in nutrient-poor soils (Lindsay & French 2005).\nIt is difficult to determine an accurate estimate of the costs of environmental weeds. However, the cost of managing Bitou Bush in New South Wales alone in 2006/07, exceeded $4.3 million (Cherry 2008).\nUrban areas: Not normally a weed of urban areas but may spread along coastal roadsides and occupy vacant areas of land where no grazing exists.",
    "controlMethods": "It is important to keep clean areas free of Bitou Bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata). Once an infestation is established, preventing the spread of seeds into surrounding areas should be a priority. This means destroying established plants before they flower and produce fruit. Any Bitou Bush plants in gardens should be destroyed since they represent a seed source and hence potential for further spread (CRC 2003). Raising awareness amongst recreational vehicle users is important, particularly in coastal areas where seed may be spread by their activities (CRC 2003). In order to minimise the amount of seed produced, it is necessary to detect as many plants as possible. The greatest difficulty is the large area infested and the rapid re-invasion of an area after initial attempts at control. A sustained control effort is required for up to ten years. Where possible an integrated management approach should be adopted, using several control methods (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides are effective against Bitou Bush and can be applied from the air, from the ground or by a cut and paint method (CRC 2003). Isolated plants can be treated with herbicide applied by spot spraying. In New South Wales low dosages of herbicides have been applied from helicopters in winter, allowing large areas to be treated rapidly with minimum impact on native species. Reports indicate better than 95% control (CRC 2003). The main four  methods of herbicide application used are:\n\n1. Cut-and-swab method where herbicide is applied to the stump of a felled plant.\n\n2. Stem injection method where herbicide is injected in the sapwood of the plant in the main stem.\n\n3. Foliar spray method where the leaves of the plant are sprayed with a herbicide solution.\n\n4. Splatter gun application method where\n\nHowever, other methods are available and  Winkler et al. (2008) can be consulted for a .\n\nNOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the four methods.\n\nPhysical control: Because Bitou Bush has a shallow root system plants up to 1 m high can be easily pulled out.\n\nCultural: Bitou Bush does not persist when grazed or cultivated. However, slashing alone is not effective as plants will re-sprout from the stump unless herbicide is applied to the stems.\n\nFire: Fire can be effective in some areas as intense fires can kill mature Bitou Bush plants and may kill Bitou Bush seeds in the litter and topsoil while stimulating germination of seeds from lower in the soil profile. These seedlings must then be removed before flowering and producing further seeds. However, fire should not be used in areas where the remnant vegetation is known to be fire-sensitive. Fire can also cause other problems such as increased erosion potential, increased traffic and access by humans and pest animals, and further invasion by weeds (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Bitou Bush has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. The first biological control agents for control of Bitou Bush and Boneseed were released in 1987. The Bitou Tip Moth (Comostolopsis germana) which destroys developing leaves, buds and flowers and reduces seed production and the Bitou Seed Fly (Mesoclanis polana), which destroys developing seed, have become well established (CRC 2003), in general biological control has had mixed success (Downey et al. 2007).\n\nSee CABI (2020); DPI NSW (2019); Winkler et al. (2008) for more detail on control methods.",

It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. Without effective control programs, Boneseed has the potential to become more abundant within its current range and to spread into new areas. Most of southern Australia, including Tasmania, is threatened by Boneseed. For example, a recent climate analysis has shown that virtually all of Victoria is potentially suitable for infestation by Boneseed (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: Boneseed is not an agricultural weed and does not persist when grazed and trampled by stock, nor when land is cultivated (CRC 2003).\n\nNative ecosystems: Boneseed has become an aggressive invader of native bush-land in Australia. Each plant produces large quantities of seed (up to 50,000 per mature healthy plants) that is readily dispersed long distances by native and feral animals allowing Boneseed infestations to establish in areas of undisturbed vegetation ranging from dunes, mallee, native grasslands and scrub, woodlands and sclerophyll forests including to Eucalyptus dominated forests, and in particular, the coastal fringe and open or scrub. Once established, its rapid regeneration and ability to spread quickly after disturbance such as fire or clearing allows it to out-compete and displace native species (CRC 2003; Brougham et al. 2006).\n\nBoneseed It is also a threat to a number of significant rare or threatened species (DPI NSW 2019).

The Coast Manna-gum (Eucalyptus viminalis subsp. pryoriana) vegetation association on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria has been severely degraded as a result of Boneseed invasion (CRC 2000), Eucalyptus microcarpa and E. porosa woodlands in SA, E. ovata. E. viminalis, and E. globulus in TAS, and eastern suburbs Banksia scrub communities in Sydney.\n\nUrban areas:  Not normally a weed of urban areas but can spread along roadsides and occupy vacant areas of land where no grazing exists.  Only rarely seen as a garden plant.",
    "controlMethods": "Considerable research and effort has been made into the control of Boneseed. As a result a range of effective control measures are available, including chemical, physical and biological control methods, also incorporating the use of fire. Because of the large and persistent seed-banks in the soil, long-term control will mean that areas have to be treated repeatedly for several years (CRC 2003). Prevention of infestation in the first instance is clearly a priority.

Larger plant may be able to be hand pulled in damp moist soil or in sandy soil. This is not possible in heavier drier soils and the use of hand tools is required to leaver plants out of the ground (e.g. the tree popper).\n\nBiological control: Boneseed has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. Attempts at biological control of Boneseed not been hugely successful so far (Brougham et al. 2006). Boneseed has been targeted for biological control but the control agents already released, including the tip moth Comostolopsis and the seed fly Mesoclanis, have failed to establish successfully. The leaf buckle mite Aceria and the rust Endophyllum osteospermi appear more promising agents. Natural regeneration or over-sowing with locally collected seed of native species can be an important part of the rehabilitation process (CRC 2003).\n\nSee the link below for detailed information on planning for and undertaking control of Boneseed as seen in ‘Boneseed Management Manual’ (available at https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/research-and-publications/publications-search/boneseed-management-manual-current-management-and-control-options-for-boneseed).",

    "habitat": "Siam Weed is an opportunistic species generally confined to forest edges and clearings and forms dense thickets in disturbed situations. It grows best in the tropics and subtropics in areas receiving 1200 mm of rainfall or more, and though not tolerant of frost it can be found at altitudes up to 1000 m. It grows on most soil types but prefers well drained soils in full sun (Hill & Ostermeyer 2000; CRC 2003). It has also been reported as occurring on stream banks, bushland, roadsides, waste areas, neglected pastures, crops and plantations (Navie 2004).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Siam Weed is on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 non-native plants that threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage. Although only in the early stages of establishment, these weeds have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: Siam Weed poses great risks to Australia's environment and economy as it is recognised as one of the world's worst tropical weeds. Siam Weed out competes and smothers crops and native vegetation, is toxic to cattle and can cause death to stock (CRC 2003, Land Protection 2007).\n\nNative ecosystems: Allelopathic effects that suppress other vegetation is listed as an impact by Hills and Ostermeyer (2000). Siam Weed can change the fire regime of infested areas, with fires becoming more frequent and intense. There are also some health issues to humans such as skin complaints and asthma in allergy-prone individuals (Land Protection 2007).\n\nHuman: Siam Weed may cause skin complaints and asthma in allergy-prone people (Weeds of Australia 2016).",
    "controlMethods": "Siam Weed is a species targeted for national eradication under the National Resource Management Ministerial Council's National Cost-Sharing Eradication Programmes. These programmes map and monitor the full distribution of the species, and coordinate or undertake activities to eradicate that species from Australia.\n\nDo not try to control Siam Weed without expert assistance from your state or territory weed management agency or local council. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: Currently herbicides are used to control Siam Weed, however the potential also exists to treat it with biological control agents. A leaf feeding moth and a gall fly have shown some success in controlling Siam Weed in Indonesia (CRC 2003).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Some other management strategies include preventing the use of unsterilised sand; maintaining strict hygiene standards for machinery; preventing stock movement and sale of pasture seed from infested areas; regulating camping and bushwalking in infested areas; and continued monitoring by landowners and governance agencies of affected jurisdictions (Maher & Funkhouser 2006).\n\nBiological control: A stem-galling fly, Cecidochares connexa, was released in certain areas of Far North Queensland as a biological control from Siam Weed (see New aerial biocontrol weapon released to help fight notorious tropical Siam weed).",

    "similarSpecies": "Siam Weed may occasionally be confused with Gymnocoronis spilanthoides (Senegal Tea Plant), Ageratina adenophora (Crofton Weed) and Ageratina riparia (Mistflower). Navie (2004) provided the following guide for distinguishing between these species:\n\nSiam Weed is a large upright, terrestrial plant 1.5-5 m tall with stems that are not hollow. Leaves are relatively broad with slightly toothed margins. Its small flower heads are 15-20 mm in diameter, pale pink or mauve in colour and borne in dense clusters at the tips of the branches.\n\nSenegal Tea Plant is an aquatic plant with somewhat hollow stems and narrowly egg shaped (ovate) or lance-shaped (lanceolate) leaves with finely toothed (serrated) margins. Flower heads are 15-20 mm in diameter and are white or purplish white and borne in clusters at the tips of the stems.\n\nCrofton Weed is an erect terrestrial plant 1-2 m tall with stems that are not hollow. Leaves are relatively broad with slightly toothed (crenate or serrate) margins. Flower heads are relatively small 5-7 mm in diameter, and are white in colour and borne in dense clusters at the tips of the branches.\n\nMistflower is a creeping or scrambling terrestrial plant 40 -60 cm high. Stems are not hollow. Leaves are relatively narrow with toothed margins. Flower heads are relatively small, about 5 mm in diameter, are white in colour and borne in dense clusters at the tips of the branches.\n\nBillygoat Weed (Ageratum conyzoides), Blue Billygoat Weed (Ageratum houstonianum) and Vernonia (Cyanthillium cinereum) have similar flowers to Siam Weed, but these are much smaller annual plants (less than 1 m) and usually have alternately arranged upper leaves.",

    "habitat": "Skeleton Weed grows in temperate, sub-humid and semi-arid open scrub-lands occurring in dry situations on well-drained sandy to moderately textured, often richer, soils, and does not readily establish on heavy textured soils (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It grows in cultivated fields and crops, especially cereal crops and frequently on fallows, being a serious weed in wheat belt areas with more than 350 mm annual rainfall, it also occurs in pastures, orchards, vineyards, gardens, waste and disturbed sites such as quarry and mine sites, roadsides, railway yards and along railway lines, and on riverbanks. Skeleton Weed has also invaded native ecosystems: mallee shrubland, grasslands, woodlands, grassy eucalypt woodland, scrub heath and coastal sandhills (McVean 1966; Cooke 1986; Panetta & Dodd 1995; Holm et al. 1997; Jeanes 1999; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2005a; Richardson et al. 2006).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Skeleton Weed (Chondrilla juncea) can form tall dense stands or thickets, and is mainly a weed of cultivated areas, paddocks, orchards, gardens, roadsides, open wasteland and other disturbed sites. It is a serious invader of pastures and cropland, particularly in cereal growing areas in the southern states with major impacts occurring in wheat-growing areas of south-eastern Australia (Cooke 1986; Panetta & Dodd 1995; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty & Associates 2003). Skeleton Weed is a potential threat to large areas of the wheat belt in Western Australia (and other agricultural areas), but eradication efforts have helped to prevent the establishment of large populations so far (Hussey et al. 1997).\n\nAgriculture: Skeleton Weed is a serious weed of cultivation causing substantial losses in cereal crop yield, especially when severe infestations compete with crops. It crowds out crops and is a strong competitor for moisture and nutrients, especially nitrogen (particularly before the crop is sown and in the early stages of crop growth). In Australia and Argentina it is a major problem of wheat fields and can reduce yields by 80% (CABI 2021). Affected crops include Cluster Clover, Cocksfoot, Japanese Millet, Lucerne, Ryegrass, Strand Medic, wheat, and White Clover. The tough wiry stems that often form tangled masses interfere with harvesting equipment by tangling within machinery, choking headers and making harvesting difficult. They can cause significant wear and tear to harvest machinery as well as causing delays through mechanical breakdowns and jamming machinery. Before effective control measures were developed, Skeleton Weed had prevented the harvesting of heavily infested wheat crops leading to cereal cropping being abandoned in many areas. It can also compete and interfere with fodder plants in sown pastures, as well as unimproved pastures weakened by drought or overgrazing (McVean 1966; Lander 1987; Felfoldi 1993; Panetta & Dodd 1995; Holm et al. 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty & Associates 2003; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2007a). As well as the financial losses resulting from reduced crop yields, there are also costs associated with control and management programs which aim to save farmers from potential greater losses. Skeleton Weed has its greatest economic impact in the cereal phase of the crop-pasture rotation (Panetta & Dodd 1995). It is drought tolerant and can provide useful grazing as the rosette leaves have value as sheep fodder and produce excellent fat lambs. However, once the stem grows and rosette leaves, die it loses much of this value and infested areas yield little fodder in the autumn or winter months (Felfoldi 1993; Panetta & Dodd 1995; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty & Associates 2003). The fibrous flowering stem has been known to cause choking and loss of condition when eaten by dairy cattle (Currie 1936, in Panetta & Dodd 1995).\n\nNative ecosystems: Skeleton Weed sometimes invades native vegetation (including woodlands, grassy eucalypt woodland, open mallee scrub, mallee shrubland, scrub heath, grasslands and coastal sandhill communities), but generally only when areas have been subjected to drought or overgrazing (McVean 1966).\n\nUrban areas: A weed of roadsides and waste place especially in agricultural areas and regional towns.",
    "controlMethods": "Skeleton Weed (Chondrilla juncea), once established, can be difficult to eradicate. Cultivation of infested areas should be avoided, especially in cultivated crops, due to the regenerating properties of cut underground stems as the chopped roots have the ability to re-shoot and establish new plants. It is also important to prevent plants from seeding. Preventing further spread using quarantine and restriction on the sale and movement of produce and machinery from affected areas will reduce the risk of spread. Farm equipment, vehicles and other objects should be checked and cleaned to prevent the movement of seed or root pieces to uninfested areas. Control is assisted through regular surveillance and public awareness, especially amongst farming communities. Infested and treated areas require regular monitoring (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Fletcher et al. 2003; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2006, 2007a, undated).\n\nChemical control:  The deep and extensive roots of Skeleton Weed make it difficult to control with chemical herbicides and successful control can only be achieved with multiple applications.  Chemical management, using herbicides often in conjunction with cropping is a valuable control tool (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2005b, 2006, 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, 2007d). Please see DPIRD (2021) and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control:  Small infestations of Skeleton Weed can be controlled by hand pulling when the soil is wet. This must be done several times per year for several years but the deep root system may resprout. Plant roots can grow to 1 metre in a single season eventually reach 2-3 meters deep.\n\nMechanical control: It is also important to prevent plants from seeding. This can be done by mowing pastures before the seeds are formed. Cultivation is not recommended as this breaks up and spreads root fragments that re-sprout and develop in to new plants.\nCompetition and management: Grazing also helps prevent or reduce seed production (e.g. continuous grazing by sheep can keep plants in the rosette stage during summer). In some areas it is useful to introduce vigorous competitive crops, such as the legumes Lucerne, Subterranean Clover and Barrel Medic, to help suppress the seedlings. Establishing a strong pasture with species that can shade out Skeleton Weed seedlings and successfully compete for soil moisture and nutrients can help control this weed (Cunningham et al. 1992; Felfoldi 1993; Panetta & Dodd 1995; Holm et al. 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Weed management has been assisted by changing from the agricultural practice of continuous cropping (which exhausts the soil and can promote the spread of Skeleton Weed) to mixed farming involving legume establishment and animal grazing (which increases soil fertility and provides a more stable farming system) (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\nBiological control: A parasitic rust fungus (Puccina chondrillia) was introduced to Australia in 1971 to control the species (Cooke 1986) together with two other control agents, a gall mite (Aceria chondrillae) and a gall midge (Cystophora schmidt).  Results were positive with initially control reducing infestations dramatically. In 1973, Hull and Groves (1973), after very careful field observations, published a paper in the Australian Journal of Botany in which they reported three forms, or biotypes, of skeleton weed in the eastern States which they labelled 'Form A, narrow leaved', 'Form C. broad leaved' and an 'intermediate, Form B'. It soon became apparent that two of the released agents, the Puccini a rust and the Aceria mite were careful to choose only the narrow leaved biotype as the host. The midge, the third agent, was capable of attacking all three forms. An integrated control program is still required using all forms of control, including competition from fertility building pastures, spot spraying and the use of selective herbicides in crops.",
    "origin": "Skeleton Weed originated in Eurasia and its native range extends from western Europe, the Mediterranean region and north Africa to central Asia. It is now found in central Europe, North and South America, Australia and New Zealand (McVean 1966; Panetta & Dodd 1995; Holm et al. 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "In the vegetative state (when flower stems are absent), Skeleton Weed has very variable rosette leaves that can be deeply lobed to only toothed, thus resembling a number of other weeds that have rosettes of lobed or toothed leaves, such as Cat's-ears (also known as Flatweed; Hypochaeris radicata), hawksbeards (Crepis spp.), Hairy Hawkbit (Leontodon saxatilis) [as Leontodon taraxacoides], Dandelion (Taraxacum cygnorum) [as Taraxacum officinale], Willow Leaf Lettuce (Lactuca saligna), Prickly Lettuce (Lactuca serriola), Capeweed (Arctotheca calendula) and various species of crucifers (family Brassicaceae). Some of these rosette look-alikes also produce branched flowering stems, yellow flowers and/or milky latex. However, Skeleton Weed can be distinguished by a combination of features:\n\nits extensive branched root system\nskeletal appearance (being highly branched with almost bare wiry stems)\nmilky latex in all plant parts\nbasal rosette leaves that are more or less hairless, soon wither, and have teeth or lobes that point back towards the plant stem\nno leaves or few or small leaves on flowering stems\nall florets yellow with a 'petal' (strap-like ligule)\nbracts (modified leaves) around flower-heads in 2 rows (the outer being minute), and\ncylindrical fruits with a conspicuous hair-like beak/column that is topped by a ring (pappus) of white bristles (Meadly 1963; Panetta & Dodd 1995; Holm et al. 1997; Sainty & Associates 2003; Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food 2005a; Richardson et al. 2006).\n\nSkeleton Weed is also related to Chicory (Cichorium intybus), which has purplish sky-blue or rarely white flowers, and Rough Sowthistle (Sonchus asper), which has numerous stem leaves that have spiny, wavy margins (Holm et al. 1997; Richardson et al. 2006).\n\nA Skeleton Weed look-alike key and similar species guides, such as those provided by O'Neil (1961), Fletcher et al. (2003) and the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food (2006), may be used to help identify the plant.",

The leaves and stems of Fanwort are covered with a thin gelatinous coating, unlike those of Hornwort. Also, the flowers of Fanwort and the Milfoils are emergent whereas the flowers of Hornwort remain fully submerged (Sainty & Jacobs 2003).",

      "The species can be spread by transport of root fragments.",

    "fruit": "",
    "reproduction": "",
    "habitat": "Spotted Knapweed occupies a wide variety of habitats in its native and naturalised ranges in Europe and in the infestations in North America (Zouhar 2001). It is a potential weed of disturbed sites, pastures, rangelands and crops in temperate and sub-tropical regions (Navie 2004).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea stoebe subsp. australis) exudes a toxin from its roots that inhibits the growth and germination of surrounding vegetation (Bais et al. 2002; Bais et al. 2003). This chemical suppression of competitors is known as allelopathy. Although Spotted Knapweed tends to initially invade disturbed sites, there is also evidence that it may then colonise adjacent undisturbed areas (Rutledge & McLendon 1996). The weed tends to form monocultures and the biodiversity of native plant communities can be impacted in areas of heavy infestation (Tyser & Key 1988) which may then have an impact on the food sources available to native fauna (Thompson 1996).\n\nAgriculture: Invasion by Spotted Knapweed can reduce the productivity of agricultural forage plants and thus decrease the amount of feed available for livestock. Despite earlier fears that Spotted Knapweed may be toxic to stock (Leininger 1988), there is evidence that sheep and cattle can safely consume it, although they exhibit a preference for plants in the earlier (rosette and early bolting) stages of their life cycle (Robbins 1990; Launchbaugh 2001). Sheep and goats have been proposed as a potential means of Spotted Knapweed control in some parts of the United States of America (Olson et al. 1997; Williams & Prather 2006), although some seeds remain viable after passing through the animals' digestive tracts and thus could germinate in a new area (Wallander et al. 1995).\n\nNative ecosystems: Spotted Knapweed can also have a negative impact on environmental factors like water infiltration, with higher levels of surface run-off and sediment yield in areas infested by Spotted Knapweed when compared to native bunchgrass vegetation (Lacey et al. 1989). Spotted Knapweed may also change the fire regime of areas it invades, as it doesn't usually burn as well as grasses, which may change the level of fuel availability at a given site (Zouhar 2001).\n\nUrban areas: The exudates of spotted Knapweed can cause skin irritation in some people and it is recommended that workers removing the weed wear gloves and take other suitable precautions to avoid contact with the sap (Colorado Weed Management Association undated).",
    "controlMethods": "Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea stoebe subsp. australis) can be controlled and managed with herbicides with young plants being physical removed ensuring perennial root is removed to avoid regeneration.  Cultivation is generally not recommended as these spreads root fragments to form new plants. The seed of Spotted Knapweed are able to survive in the soil for well over five years (Davis et al. 1993), so populations must be revisited to remove new seedlings and resprouts (Bio-Integral Resources Center 2000). Given the persistent nature of the plant it is likely that a strategic integrated approach will be necessary to effectively prevent the spread of Spotted Knapweed (Brown et al. 1999).\n\nChemical control:  Herbicide is effective in controlling small populations if applied when plants are actively growing, particularly in the bolt and bud stages (Sheley et al. 2000), Please also check the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Single plants or small populations can be removed by hand before setting seed, as long as the entire tap root is pulled out.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation is not effective as it will not disturb the deep roots of the plants. In addition, it may spread fragments of root, spreading the infestation.\nCompetition and management: Once controlled Spotted Knapweed is likely to re-invade unless the areas are re-vegetated so that competition from other vegetation remains high and suppresses the weed (Kennett et al. 1992; Lindquist et al. 1996).\nFire: Targeted fires can have a significant effect on Spotted Knapweed populations, with annual summer burning the most effective regime to reduce reproduction (Emery & Gross 2005). However, as the plant can regenerate from top-burnt root-stocks and since the seeds are likely to survive all but severe fires (Abella & MacDonald 2000), using fire alone may simply open more space for seedlings to colonise and increase the sunlight available to them (Sheley et al. 1999).",
    "origin": "Spotted Knapweed is native to southern central to south-eastern Europe and north-western Asia (Ochsmann 2001), although it has also subsequently been introduced to western and northern Europe, Asia and New Zealand. It was also accidentally introduced to North America in the late 1800s from Europe, probably as a contaminant of alfalfa or clover seed or in soil discarded after use as ships' ballast, and has since become a widespread weed occupying millions of hectares in the United States of America and Canada (Carpinelli 2005).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea stoebe subsp. micranthos) is very similar to Black Knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and Greater Knapweed (Centaurea scabiosa). It is also relatively similar to Creeping Knapweed (Rhaponticum repens) [as Acroptilon repens] and Star Thistle (Centaurea calcitrapa).\n\nBlack Knapweed  (Centaurea nigra) is also a perennial herb, but it differs from Spotted Knapweed in usually having entire (undivided) leaves in the basal rosette. The stem immediately below the floral head is thickened in Black Knapweed but not in Spotted Knapweed (Dellow & Johnson undated). The floral bracts in Black Knapweed are mostly black or dark brown with numerous blackish hairs, whereas in Spotted Knapweed they are green to brownish with black or dark purple only near the tips and with only 4–7 pairs of hairs on the margin. The seeds of Black Knapweed have a few short bristles in a pappus (tuft) at the top which are about 0.5 mm long, while Spotted Knapweed has whitish feathery bristles reaching 1–2 mm long.\n\nGreater Knapweed  (Centaurea scabiosa) is also a perennial herb with lobed or deeply-divided leaves in the basal rosette, but its flower heads are generally larger than those of Spotted Knapweed (15–20 mm across compared to 5-15 mm across, both measurements not including florets). The seeds of Greater Knapweed are pale yellow or brown with a pappus of dark purplish bristles 4-5 mm long, while Spotted Knapweed seeds are pale brown to blackish with a shorter pappus of whitish bristles.\n\nCreeping Knapweed (Rhaponticum repens) is also a perennial herb with toothed or lobed lower leaves. However, it differs from Spotted Knapweed by having greenish to pale yellowish floral bracts with paler, papery tips which lack hairs in contrast to the dark-tipped and fringed bracts in Spotted Knapweed. The seeds of Creeping Knapweed are topped with whitish bristles (pappus) as are those of Spotted Knapweed, but the pappus in Creeping Knapweed seeds detaches easily while it persists in Spotted Knapweed. In addition, Creeping Knapweed seeds are whitish or sometimes mottled with darker streaks or blotches while Spotted Knapweed has brown to blackish seeds.\n\nStar Thistle (Centaurea calcitrapa) is a biennial plant which has lobed or deeply-divided basal leaves and has relatively small flowering heads like Spotted Knapweed. However, in Star Thistle the bracts surrounding the heads are green to brown with a large yellowish or whitish spine at the tip and several smaller spines near the base, whereas in Spotted Knapweed the bracts lack spines. Star Thistle has whitish seeds with brown streaks or blotches and the seeds are not topped with hairs or scales, in contrast to the brown or blackish seeds with whitish feathery bristles found in Spotted Knapweed (Navie 2004).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "St Barnaby's Thistle (Centaurea solstitialis) will out-compete crops and pastures and dense patches can restrict stock movement in areas where rainfall is above 600 mm. In drier areas will invade roadside waste land and unimproved pastures.\n\nReports from the United States suggest that the rosettes are toxic to horses and cause a neurological disorder. Similar symptoms have been noted occasionally in Australia (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; SNWCB 2007).\n\nAgriculture: St Barnaby's Thistle is not readily eaten by livestock except when very young. Overseas evidence reports that plants compete with useful pastures, by producing chemicals which may reduce germination of its own seeds and restrict growth of other species, both of which place it at a competitive advantage. This effect reduces the carrying capacity of the land (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Plants of this species often occur in dense patches which restrict stock movement and can injure dogs, humans and grazing animals, particularly in the eyes, mouth and feet, and contribute to vegetable fault in wool (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). St Barnaby's Thistle inhabits pastures, rangelands, crops, fallows as well as waste areas, disturbed sites and roadsides and occasionally invades unimproved grazing land (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Navie 2004).\n\nNative ecosystems: St. Barnaby's thistle (Centaurea solstitialis) can form dense impenetrable stands that displace desirable vegetation in natural grasslands, rangelands. This can lead to a reduction in the habitat available to wildlife and decrease the native plant and animal diversity in densely infested areas.\n\nUrban areas: A weed of roadsides and neglected sites especially in drier areas.",
    "controlMethods": "St Barnaby's Thistle (Centaurea solstitialis) can be controlled by herbicides when plants are young, by cultivation and by pasture management.\n\nChemical control:  Herbicide application at the seedling or immature growth stage can also control this species (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). See DPI NSW (2019) for further herbicide information. Please also check the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Single plants or small populations can be removed by hand or chipping out if recently new to an area.\n\nMechanical control: Seedlings and immature plants are controlled by shallow cultivation but this must be repeated to deal with the subsequent germination (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Mowing or slashing can help manage St Barnaby's Thistle, however, this should be done at the right time, too early and plants may regrow and set seed, and to late when in flower may allow seeds too mature on cut material.\nCompetition and management: Effective control can be maintained by encouraging legume-based pastures which, with adequate fertiliser, provide maximum competition to the weed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Experiments have shown that the common native ringed wallaby grass (Rytidosperma caespitosum) [as Austrodanthonia caespitosa] competes strongly with St Barnaby's Thistle and may be a factor in preventing invasion of South Australia's native grasslands (Hay et al. 2006). Other studies suggest nutrients, seed origin (seed from overseas may be more competitive that Australian seed) and identity of competing species are important factors in preventing invasion of Australian grasslands by St Barnaby's Thistle (Hay et al. 2007).",

It impact pastures on fertile soils in areas with annual rainfall higher than 750 mm (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) and is a weed of roadside and disturbed sites.\n\nAgriculture: Black Knapweed plants are not readily eaten by livestock and compete with useful pastures, possibly with allelopathic effects (by producing chemicals that may reduce the germination and early seedling development of other species). This in turn reduces the carrying capacity of the land.\n\nNative ecosystems: Not widely known as a weed of native vegetation, but  impact native ecosystems (Agriculture Victoria 2021).\n\nUrban areas: Known as a weed of urban areas elsewhere in the world where it has naturalised, and found in gardens, urban areas, waste places, and roadsides, and could invade similar areas in Australia.",
    "controlMethods": "Black Knapweed (Centaurea nigra) can be managed by chemical and small plants can be removed by hand removing the entire tap root. Any remaining roots (rhizomes) may regrow. Cultivation should not be used as this will spread root fragments within areas and on machinery to clean areas.\n\nChemical control: Herbicide application is effective if applied when plants are actively growing. The soil surrounding the plant for a radius of about 60 cm should also be treated to kill the rhizomes (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Dellow & Johnson undated). A common weed in the US where chemical control is used. See Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001) for further herbicide information. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Plants can be removed by hand before they set seed.\n\nCompetition and management:   In the pastures it is important to maintain a competitive pasture to minimise establishment of the seedlings. Treat any new emergence of thistles with either physical measures or herbicide.\nMechanical control: Cultivation is not an effective method of control as it will not remove the deep roots of the plants but may actually may spread fragments of root, resulting in further infestation. Mowing (clipping) Mow or cut plants before flowering to prevent seed-set but plants may require follow-up to prevent further seed-set or chemical control to kill above and all below ground spreading roots (rhizomes).",

Creeping Knapweed flower heads are similar in size to Black Knapweed but have greenish or pale yellow bracts with papery, hairless tips. Greater Knapweed seeds are pale yellow or brown in colour, similar to those of Black Knapweed but have a pappus (tuft) of much longer, dark-purplish bristles 4-5 mm long. Creeping Knapweed seeds are whitish in colour (sometimes mottled) and topped with numerous whitish hairs forming a pappus which detaches easily.\n\nSpotted Knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) may be short-lived (biennial) or long-lived (perennial), while Star Thistle (Centaurea calcitrapa) is a biennial species. Both have lobed or deeply divided lower leaves and flower heads similar in size to those of Black Knapweed but enclosed with green to brown bracts. The bracts of Spotted Knapweed have a blackish tip and a fringe of hairs along the upper margin while those of Star Thistle have a large yellow or white spine 10-30 mm long at the tip and smaller spines near the base. Spotted Knapweed seeds are similar in colour to those of Black Knapweed but are topped with a pappus of white, feathery bristles (Navie 2004).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Star Thistle (Centaurea calcitrapa) impacts agriculture and is found in native vegetation. A weed of pastures, roadsides, wastelands, disturbed sites and cultivated areas in southern Australia, but also invades native grasslands, open woodlands, rangelands and conservation areas.\n\nAgriculture: Star Thistle Star thistle forms a dense mat that competes with, and excludes desirable crop and pasture species (DPI NSW 2019). Once heads are formed, their spines that surround the flower-heads may injure grazing animals particularly in the eyes and mouth, and make access to pasture species for grazing difficult in the immediate vicinity. The spines also make clumps of the plant an effective harbour for rabbits. It is believed that Star Thistle may be toxic to animals but as it is rarely grazed, this is not of great importance (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: It may invade native grasslands, open woodlands, and conservation areas especially degraded open native vegetation. Occurs in open woodlands, grasslands and conservation area and is regarded as an environmental weed in southern Australia. Does not normally invade healthy dense vegetation. In Victoria it is known to invade lowland grassland, grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland. It is seen as a serious threat to one or more of these vegetation formations and has the potential to displace species in the lower stratum (Carr et al. 1992; VRO 2007).\n\nUrban areas: A weed of roadsides and waste places especially in poorer or degraded soils. The spiny nature of Star Thistle has the potential to injure humans that come in contact with it (VRO 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Star Thistle (Centaurea calcitrapa) can be managed by chemical and physical means. Cultivation can stimulate the germination of seeds. Using cultivation combined with herbicides can give positive results as long as thistles are treated at the seedling or rosette stage of growth, usually during winter and early spring.\n\nChemical control: Star Thistle is susceptible to various chemical treatments in the seedling, rosette and pre-flowering stages (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). See DPI NSW (2019) & Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001) for further herbicide information. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Isolated plants should be grubbed out, ensuring that the bulk of the taproot is removed. If near the seeding stage, these plants should be heaped and burnt to destroy seeds.\n\nCompetition and management:  For larger infestations, cultivation is effective particularly in the early growth stages. Once the plants reach the rosette stage, cultivation must be at least 10 cm deep to sever the taproot at a depth from which regrowth does not occur. Cultivation can be combined with growing a fodder crop or establishing a pasture which should be adequately top dressed and only lightly grazed in order to provide maximum competition to seedlings (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In the pasture phase, it is important to maintain a competitive pasture. Treat any new emergence of thistles with either physical measures or herbicide. In cropping situations, cultivation can stimulate the germination of seeds. Using cultivation combined with herbicides can give positive results as long as thistles are treated at the seedling or rosette stage of growth, usually during winter and early spring.\nMechanical control:  Slashing is effective if carried out just before flowering. Mowing is equally effective but, if left until early flowering, there may be enough food material in the cut stems to allow the seeds to mature. Slashing on the other hand, has the advantage of destroying many of the seed heads. If either slashing or mowing is carried out too early, the plants may regrow from buds at the base and produce new flowering stems.",

It is also relatively similar to St. Barnaby's Thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), Maltese Cockspur (Centaurea melitensis) and Saffron Thistle (Carthamus lanatus) (Navie 2004).\n\nSpotted Knapweed, Black Knapweed and Creeping Knapweed all have similar spineless stems and leaves to Star Thistle, however the purplish flower heads of these species are enclosed in several rows of spineless bracts (modified leaves), whereas those of Star Thistle end in spines. The margins of the bracts of Black Knapweed and Creeping Knapweed are fringed with black hairs up to 2.5 mm long, whereas those of Creeping Knapweed are papery only. The seeds of all three of these species are topped with a pappus (tuft) of bristles or hairs, although in Creeping Knapweed these can easily become detached. The seeds of Star Thistle have no appendages like bristles or hairs (Navie 2004).\n\nSoldier Thistle differs from Star Thistle in having spiny, winged stems and spiny leaves. Its pinkish or purplish flower heads are similar as they are enclosed in several rows of spine-tipped bracts but the seeds of Soldier Thistle are topped with a pappus of numerous feathery white bristles (Navie 2004).\n\nWhite-stemmed Distaff Thistle has spineless stems like Star Thistle but its leaves are spiny and the undersides are often without hairs (although the young leaves sometimes have a cobwebby appearance).

Unlike Star Thistle, their flower heads are yellow rather than purple and the seeds may or may not be topped with a pappus of numerous bristly hairs (Navie 2004).\n\nSaffron Thistle also has spineless stems like Star Thistle but generally there are no hairs on the undersides of its spiny leaves (although the young leaves sometimes have a cobwebby appearance). The flower heads are yellow rather than purple and are enclosed in several rows of spiny bracts, the outer rows of which are turned downwards.

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: Spiny Burrgrass burrs cause a range of problems such as injury to people and dogs. The burrs can become badly tangled in wool thereby lowering its value. There is an economic cost as the burrs slow down shearing resulting in overtime penalty rates as working with contaminated wool requires leather gloves and/or aprons adding to the cost of production. Spines can cause injury to stock resulting in swellings and ulcers in the mouth, and they easily puncture the skin of animals thus affecting the value of hides. Fruiting plants are an inconvenience to agricultural workers of irrigated crops especially when working in vegetable, vine, citrus and tobacco crops, with burrs contaminating dried fruit crops and lucerne hay (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Although easily controlled in lucerne, burr contamination can reduce the value of lucerne hay. As it is spring-summer growing, innocent weed is not a competitor with the major broad acre-crops.\n\nUrban areas: It also infests some urban areas as a weed of footpaths, bare street-scapes and recreation grounds, although it is less of an issue in maintained gardens and lawns (Government of South Australia 2021).",
    "controlMethods": "Spiny Burrgrass can be controlled by physical and chemical means.  Prevention of seedlings is the key to successful control. Good hygiene practices such as cleaning of machinery and vehicles also aids in controlling spread (Mullen et al. 2005). Once established in dryland areas, innocent weed is very difficult to control because seed may remain viable in the burrs for at least five years. Some seed readily germinates after summer rains, but others in the same burr will remain dormant to germinate later, even skipping a year if there is a shortage of rain in late spring and summer (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nNon-chemical control: Preventing seeding is the key to successful control. This can be achieved by cultivation before seed formation, preferably at the seedling stage as larger plants are difficult to turn completely over. Repeated cultivation is necessary to kill subsequent seedlings. Heavy grazing by sheep also prevents seedlings but is not always practical. Well managed pastures can out-compete and exclude establishment of Spiny Burrgrass.\n\nChemical control: Application of herbicides to actively growing plants is effective (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Innocent weed can generally be controlled in most irrigated and horticultural crops to prevent contamination of produce, but due to several germination events in one season, repeat treatments may be needed during the growing season. Control of broad acre infestations by herbicide can be prohibitively expensive compared to the income produced from the land. A number of herbicides provide control.\n\nPlease see Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018); DPI NSW (2019); the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "impact": "Fountain grass is a highly invasive tufted grass. Once escaped, this grass can form dense stands (monocultures) that exclude all other plants. It has been used for soil stabilisation and is a weed of pastures, grasslands, and alongside transport corridors like railway lines, roads, tracks, paths and waterways. It can increase fire risk compared to other roadside weeds that accumulate less dry matter. Fountain grass is well adapted to post-fire regeneration, and burning may contribute to its invasion, with fires hotter than native grass fires resulting in damage to native plant species and communities that are not as fire tolerant. (Government Of South Australia 2021; Johnson undated).\n\nAgriculture: Mainly invades degraded paddocks and similar areas. It is of little value to grazing due to its rough course leaves which make it unpalatable to stock\n\nNative ecosystems: Fountain Grass forms dense swards and is regarded as highly invasive.  Fountain grass out-competes and suppresses native vegetation and greatly increases fire risk (DPI NSW 2019).  It invades grasslands, gassy woodlands, and degraded habitat, and mature flowerings plants are  also unpalatable to most if not all native animals.\n\nUrban areas: Plants are used as ornamental in gardens and along roadsides, and are often found in motel gardens or amenity plantings, becoming weedy along paths and roads near waterways and forms these dense infestations it can have high nuisance value, impeding both pedestrian and vehicular access.",
    "controlMethods": "Fountain Grass is difficult to eliminate. Control may need to be repeated several times a year. The long-lived seeds make continued monitoring after treatment is essential. Research has shown that seeds of fountain grass can remain viable in soil for up to 10 years in the soil, implying the presence of a significant seed bank that makes continued monitoring after control treatment essential (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nNon-chemical control: Control should initially be directed to outlying populations followed by treatment of the core area. Small infestations of Fountain Grass can be removed by uprooting and removing and destroying seed-heads. Slashing and mowing cam help reduce the amount of seed heads produced, but it is a prolific seeder and this is a short term method only.\n\nChemical control: Extensive infestations of Fountain Grass are probably best controlled with herbicides, combined with mechanical techniques (Johnson undated). Foliar spraying and wick-wipe are effective application methods.\n\nPlease see: Brisbane City Council (2021); DPI NSW 2019; Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018); and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

The best diagnostic feature to separate these four species is whether the bristles surrounding the flowers are themselves plumose (hairy) or not.\n\nFountain Grass and Feathertop both have plumose bristles. However, they can also be distinguished by the colour of the whole inflorescence – purple or pink in Fountain Grass and creamy coloured in Feathertop. Both Swamp Foxtail and African Feather Grass both have bristles lacking hairs (Slee 2007, pers. comm.). Queens;and Overnemnt (2016) summerise the look-a-like species as follows:\n\nFountain grass (Cenchrus setaceus) is a moderately-sized long-lived (i.e. perennial) grass (50–150 cm tall) with relatively elongated, reddish or pinkish-coloured seed-heads. The main stem (i.e. rachis) of the seed-head is angular and the long bristles (up to 25 mm or more) are hairy (i.e. plumose).\n\nAfrican feather grass (Cenchrus macrourus) is a large long-lived (i.e. perennial) grass (usually 1–2 m tall) with very elongated, greenish or yellowish-coloured seed-heads. The main stem (i.e. rachis) of the seed-head is rounded and the relatively short bristles (mostly less than 10 mm long) are rough (i.e. scabrous).\n\nMission grass (Cenchrus polystachios) is a large long-lived (i.e. perennial) grass (usually 2–3 m tall) with very elongated, yellowish or brownish-coloured seed-heads. The main stem (i.e. rachis) of the seed-head is angular and the relatively long  bristles (4–25 mm long) are hairy (i.e. plumose).\n\nDeenanth grass (Cenchrus pedicellatus) is a moderately-sized short-lived (i.e. annual or perennial) grass (usually 30–150 cm tall) with elongated, pale purplish-coloured seed-heads. The main stem (i.e. rachis) of the seed-head is angular and the relatively long bristles (6–24 mm long) are hairy (i.e. plumose).\n\nSwamp foxtail (Cenchrus purpurascens) is a moderately-sized long-lived (i.e. perennial) grass (usually 60–100 cm tall) with relatively elongated, purplish-coloured seed-heads.

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Mission Grass was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WoNS). Following an assessment process, Mission Grass was not included as one of the 20 WoNS, nor was it included in a list of further WoNS in 2012 (Thorp & Wilson 1998–). However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: Mission Grass is an important roadside weed in the coastal districts of northern Australia and is commonly seen as a dense monoculture on roadsides in the Northern Territory. It also invades cultivation, wastelands, pastures and conservation areas. In the Northern Territory it has been reported to reduce the yield of summer crops (e.g. sorghum, maize and cotton) and the viability of sown pastures (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Miller 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: Mission Grass is a potentially significant environmental weed in northern Australia, where it is currently listed as a priority environmental weed in three Natural Resource Management regions. It is already having a significant impact in the northern parts of the Northern Territory and is actively managed by community groups in this region (Navie & Adkins 2007). Once established, Mission Grass has a competitive advantage over short-lived grasses and replaces native species, threatening natural biodiversity (Miller 2006).\n\nThe main impact this exotic grass has on native vegetation is the change it can have on the fire regime (Smith 2002). The above-ground parts dry off each year and, being very robust in nature, they create a very high fuel load (Douglas et al. 2004). This results in extremely hot fires late in the dry season which carry flames into the canopy of trees. These wildfires accelerate its invasion into native bushland and can result in the death of trees and the replacement of the natural savannas with exotic grasslands (Miller 2006; Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nMission Grass invasions into savanna woodlands were shown to lead to a decrease in species richness and abundance of native species (Brooks et al. 2010). The invasion of Mission Grass and other exotic grasses in the Wildman and Mary River catchments, and in Kakadu National Park, is also known to be threatening the survival of some native animals. For example, it has caused a decline in the quality of the habitat available to the endangered Yellow-snouted Ground Gecko (Diplodactylus occultus), making its geographic distribution limited and its survival precarious (Navie & Adkins 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Control programs should aim to restrict the spread of Mission Grass, prevent its entry to clean areas, reduce the fire hazard, and to reduce competition in crops and pastures. Small infestations can be hand-pulled or dug out with a hoe (Miller 2006). Check with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for the control of Mission Grass.\n\nNon-chemical control: In cultivation, mature plants can be ploughed in prior to planting sown pastures or crops (Miller 2006), and a combination of cultivation and herbicide application usually gives the best results. In pastures, a combination of herbicide application and grazing management gives the best results (Parsons and Cuthbertson 2001). Slashing the plants before seed maturity will lessen the fire hazard and can be particularly useful along roadsides, as long as mature seeds are not present to be spread about by the machinery (Miller 2006).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides should be applied to Mission Grass that is actively growing prior to seeding, using spot sprays, rope wicks or boom sprays. Spot spraying is useful in newly infested areas or in areas of light infestation, while rope wicks and boom sprayers are more applicable to larger and denser infestations. Areas that have been recently slashed or burned provide an actively growing infestation with a reduced surface area, and this is the best situation for the application of herbicides (Miller 2006). However, fire should be used carefully as it can promote Mission Grass invasion if it is used at the wrong time of year (i.e. when fuel loads are very high).\n\nSee the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "Mission Grass is thought to be native to tropical and sub-tropical Africa (from Ethiopia and west tropical Africa south to Mozambique), and possibly also tropical Asia. It is now present throughout all the tropical regions of the world (i.e., it is pan-tropical) (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; GRIN 2007).",

It is most often confused with Annual Mission Grass, also known as Deenanth grass, which has purplish coloured seed-heads and is a shorter-lived plant.",

It grows in lowland grassland and open grassy woodland, along the banks of rivers and creeks, in seasonal freshwater wetlands, roadsides, pasture, and low-lying areas subject to flooding, spreading to drier surrounding areas and waste areas where adequate moisture is available (Blood 2001). It is often found on sandy soils (Thorp & Wilson 1998 -) and tolerates drought, wind, salt and grazing (Blood 2001). It requires full sun, with dense infestation only rarely occurring within shaded bushland environments (Tasmania Department of Primary Industries and Water 2002).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "African Feather Grass has proved a useful plant for soil stabilisation, particularly around road verges (Tasmania Department of Primary Industries and Water 2002). It is a weed of roadsides, waste areas, river banks and poorly maintained pastures and is now regarded as a serious environmental weed. It is a highly invasive clump-forming perennial grass, capable of rapid spread due to its vigorous rhizome system forming dense infestations that completely eliminate all other plants. Young plants are very ornamental and in the past were planted in gardens. Large infestations reduce biodiversity, block access to waterways and present a significant fire hazard (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nNative ecosystems: Dense infestations presents a significant fire hazard, reduces biodiversity by excluding native flora and blocks waterways and access to them (Johnson 2005). Large infestations are an ideal haven for rabbits and feral cats (Tasmania Department of Primary Industries and Water 2002). A weed of low land grassland and grassy woodland, dense infestations suppress over-storey regeneration impacting native species’ biomass (Government of South Australia 2021). Dense infestation can displace grass species in already endangered native grassland situations, such as iron grass (Lomandra multiflora, Lomandra effusa) grasslands and the peppermint box (Eucalyptus odorata) grassy woodlands. Due to African feathergrass capacity to invade riparian vegetation and freshwater wetlands, it has impacts recreational activities through preventing access to streams and rivers. However, with the potential to block waterways and channels, it would negatively affect stream flows (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nAgriculture:  The leaves are quite tough and coarse and are low in nutritional content. They are rarely grazed by stock, even in times of low available feed (Tasmania Department of Primary Industries and Water 2002). African feathergrass poses several risks to agricultural industries, especially in higher rainfall, perennial pasture grazing areas. Once established in a perennial pasture improving the pasture alone does not control the weed as under suitable conditions dense clumps can virtually eliminate all other plants. It is not known as a food source for native fauna or pest animals, but its dense growth provides habitat for rabbits. The seeds are equipped to cling to the wool and hair of animals, therefore there is potential to reduce wool quality (Government of South Australia 2021).",
    "controlMethods": "Control of African Feather Grass requires a program involving multiple cultivation, herbicide use and pasture improvement. Repeated treatments over a long period of time are required to exhaust the reserves in the rhizomes.\n\nNon-chemical control: A key to African Feather Grass control is plant competition from desirable plant species with the emerging African feather grass plants. This includes perennial pastures in grazing areas and suitable shrubs or trees along waterways, waste areas and roadsides (Johnson 2005). Seedlings and small infestations can be dug up (Tasmania Department of Primary Industries and Water 2002). Small plants can be physically removed using a spade or mattock. Care is required to remove all rhizome fragments from the soil. Larger plants may need heavy machinery such as an excavator to remove the whole plant. Excavated soil should be checked for all root and rhizome fragments or piled in an area that can be monitored for regrowth.\n\nChemical control: is an effective option for management of African Feather Grass.  Herbicides provide an effective follow-up treatment on excavated, slashed or burnt plants when regrowth is approximately 40 cm high. Spraying is recommended in spring to autumn following slashing in winter. Herbicide treatment should be followed up until there is no longer any regrowth (Tasmania Department of Primary Industries and Water 2002). Application is via spot spraying, broadacre control, and labour intensive wiping leaves with tongs with herbicide in sensitive environmental areas. For large dense infestations a Slash or burn and spray regrowth (spring-autumn) can be effective.\n\nPlease see: Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018);  the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Innocent Weed is a weed because of its sharp and clingy burr, its ability to spread rapidly, and tendency to develop into dense infestations in favourable conditions. It is also difficult and expensive to manage, especially in marginal rainfall areas.\n\nAgriculture: Innocent Weed burrs cause a range of problems such as, injury to people and dogs, can become badly tangled in wool thereby lowering its value. There is an economic cost as the burrs slow down shearing resulting in overtime penalty rates as working with contaminated wool requires leather gloves and/or aprons adding to the cost of production. Spines can cause injury to stock resulting in swellings and ulcers in the mouth ulcers in the mouths, and they easily puncture the skin of animals thus affecting the value of hides and they can cause . Fruiting plants are an inconvenience to agricultural workers of irrigated crops. Burrs can contaminate dried fruit crops and lucerne hay (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Although easily controlled in lucerne, burr contamination can reduce the value of lucerne hay. As it is spring-summer growing, innocent weed is not a competitor with the major broad acre-crops.\n\nUrban areas: It also infests some urban areas as a weed of footpaths, bare streetscapes and recreation grounds, although it is less of an issue in maintained gardens and lawns (Government of South Australia 2021).",
    "controlMethods": "Innocent Weed can be controlled by physical and chemical means. Good hygiene practices such as cleaning of machinery and vehicles also aids in controlling spread (Mullen et al. 2005). Once established in dryland areas, innocent weed is very difficult to control because seed may remain viable in the burrs for at least five years. Some seed readily germinates after summer rains, but others in the same burr will remain dormant to germinate later, even skipping a year if there is a shortage of rain in late spring and summer (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nNon-chemical control: Preventing seeding is the key to successful control. This can be achieved by cultivation before seed formation, preferably at the seedling stage as larger plants are difficult to turn completely over. Repeated cultivation is necessary to kill subsequent seedlings. Heavy grazing by sheep also prevents seedlings but is not always practical. Well managed pastures also exclude establishment of Innocent Weed.\n\nChemical control: Application of herbicides to actively growing plants is effective (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Innocent weed can generally be controlled in most irrigated and horticultural crops to prevent contamination of produce, but due to several germination events in one season, repeat treatments may be needed during the growing season. Control of broad acre infestations by herbicide can be prohibitively expensive compared to the income produced from the land.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

Innocent Weed (Cenchrus longispinus) can be distinguished from these by spiny 'burrs' which are produced on its seed head. These 'burrs' have short stalks and have several rows of larger flattened spines, usually with 40–70 spines in total.

The burrs on Mossman River grass (Cenchrus echinatus) do not have stalks and only have one row of larger flattened spines. Buffel Grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) has seed heads that do not produce spiny 'burrs'. Instead, its seed heads bear flower spikelet clusters that have numerous long stiff bristles (Navie 2004).",

    "impact": "Longstyle feather grass is not eaten by livestock but can take over pastures, lawns, vineyards, roadsides, railways, rivers, streams and creeks, open and degraded areas .\n\nAgriculture: Longstyle Feather Grass is unpalatable to stock and able to increase in infested pastures. It spreads in pasture, successfully competing with desirable pasture plants and therefore reducing the grazing area, leading to dominance of the weed species where it occurs (Thorp & Wilson 1998 – ; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Around Inverell in New South Wales it is a contaminant of wool (North West Weeds 2007).\n\nNative ecosystems: Occupies degraded roadside vegetation and can invade riparian vegetation especially in drier areas, replacing native and desirable species. ‘It may occasionally become an environmental weed of grassy woodlands and grasslands, and can occur in coastal areas and along creeks and river banks (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nUrban areas: Longstyle feather grass has been frequently cultivated as an ornamental grass in Australia, and is often a weed of footpaths and vacant land.",
    "controlMethods": "Control methods for Longstyle Feather Grass include cultivation (removal of plant) and herbicides.\n\nNon-chemical control: This is a tough deep rooted grass and not recommended for hand weeding with tools unless plants are young and the underground rhizomes (rooting stems) can be removed. Cultivation must be thorough and repeated regularly to remove all rhizome fragments (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: Herbicides can be applied through a rope wick applicator or via spot spraying when plant is actively growing (DPI NSW 2019). Similar methods for application and timing can be employed for other tough summer growing tussock grasses.\n\nPlease see DPI NSW (2019) and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

The burrs can also cause injury to stock, horses and dogs (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

Repeated treatments are required to control new seedlings as they emerge.

Mossman River Grass can be distinguished from these species by the stalkless burr found on seed heads which have one row of larger flattened spines. Spiny Burrgrass (Cenchrus spinifex) [as Cenchrus incertus] has burrs that are almost stalkless with several rows of larger flattened spines. Spiny Burrgrass (Cenchrus longispinus) has shortly stalked burrs with several rows of larger flattened spines. Buffel Grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) has seed-heads that do not produce spiny 'burrs'. Instead, its seed-heads bear flower spikelet clusters that have numerous long stiff bristles (Navie 2004).",

    "habitat": "Chinese Celtis is a widespread weed in damp coastal areas, particularly along banks of waterways and near rainforest (Harden & Murray 2000; Weeds Australia undated). It favours disturbed sites (Land Protection 2006) and is commonly found on clay soils (Weeds Australia undated).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Chinese Celtis was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Chinese Celtis was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. a weed of waterways and riverbanks (i.e. in riparian areas), roadsides, urban bushland, open woodlands, rainforest margins, waste areas, disturbed sites, parks and gardens in sub-tropical and warm temperate regions (NSW DPI 2019).\n\nAgriculture: Chinese Celtis is a large, invasive tree that has become an environmental weed and a potential weed of agriculture because of its ability to become structurally dominant.  It may impede stocks access especially to waterways.\n\nNative ecosystems: Previously cleared, regenerating riparian sites, and widespread along the north coast of New South Wales and the south coast of Queensland. Such sites are ideal for weeds such as Chinese Celtis, and for the frequently associated Camphor Laurel. Chinese Celtis is quick growing, even in dry conditions, and can rapidly form dense thickets that dominate river bank vegetation and prevent the regeneration of indigenous riparian species and negatively affect associated indigenous fauna through habitat destruction (Land Protection 2006). Dense infestations of Chinese Celtis also have the potential to impact on agriculture by competing for scarce irrigation water and moisture for crops and pastures (Armstrong & Keegan 1996).",
    "controlMethods": "Seedlings of Chinese Celtis under 30 cm high can be hand pulled or dug out (Armstrong & Keegan 1996; Land Protection 2006). Large trees may also be cut down and the stump dug up and removed (Enseby 2002). A major source of seed spread into urban bushland is from old mature heavily fruiting trees planted many years ago in private gardens. It is important that these trees are identified and removed (North Coast Weeds Advisory Committee 2004).\n\nChemical control: Various herbicides are registered for the control of Chinese Celtis. Methods recommended include stem injection for plants up to 30 cm basal diameter, application to basal bark for young plants up to 2 m high and 20 cm basal diameter, application to cut stumps, spot spraying for young plants less than 2 m high and foliar spraying of seedlings. See Armstrong and Keegan (1996) and the North Coast Weeds Advisory Committee (2004) for details.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual removal of isolated small seedlings can be attempted by hand pulling or digging them up. This is only practical for a small number of plants. Large trees may be cut down and the stump dug up and removed. Care should be taken to avoid moving fruit to un-infested areas when manually removing mature trees.\n\nDue to the associated spread of Chinese Celtis and camphor laurel into disturbed riparian areas, it is important that control of both species is undertaken concurrently. Otherwise one will replace the other (North Coast Weeds Advisory Committee 2004).",

It is tolerant of a wide range of soils, preferring deep loamy silts and clays. It can also survive on shallow, gravelly and rocky sites. It cannot grow in the shade but it does tolerate frost and drought. Seeds germinate well in cultivated well watered gardens with rich free draining soil. Where it is cultivated as a street tree in temperate areas, it matures to an ideal compact size and provides dense shade in summer. Many seedlings germinate in gardens, parks, roadsides, verges and wasteland. Occasionally found in areas of natural vegetation with parent trees in the vicinity (Brodie et al. 2016). It is grown as shade or street tree but has been spread by birds and now invades woodlands, urban rivers and forests (NSW DPI 2019).",

    "impact": "European Nettle Tree (Celtis australis) is used as an ornamental plant to provide shade and shelter and it is an ideal street specimen (Blood 2001) especially in urban areas as it is resistant to air pollution and is very long lived (Ciceran 2007). They are planted around cultivated fields as a boundary and for shelter and support. In Australia, Nettle Tree invades woodland, urban areas, river margins and pine plantations (Blood 2001). In South Africa, the Nettle Tree invades urban open space and river banks (Henderson 2001). The pollen is moderately allergenic (Ciceran 2007).\n\nNettle Tree timber is very tough, pliable and durable, and widely used by turners. The flexible thin shoots are used as walking sticks. The wood makes an excellent fuel (Ciceran 2007). Nettle Tree leaves are eaten in soups and salads. The fruits are edible and pleasant tasting (Blood 2001) and oil can be obtained from the seeds (Ciceran 2007). Extracts of Nettle Tree leaves and fruit are used medicinally to improve digestion and appetite, relieve pain and as an astringent (Ciceran 2007). Extracts are also used as a vermifuge (a substance that expels or destroys intestinal worms) and to treat oedema, headache and boils. The leaves and fruit are gathered in early summer and dried for later use. The fruit, particularly before it is fully ripe, is considered to be more effective as a medicine (Ciceran 2007).\n\nAgriculture: Not a known weed of Agriculture, but may self seed around the margins if mature plants are present. Leaves and twigs are lopped for fodder in the dry season. The quality of the leaves is reported to be high, with 15% crude protein, good palatability and digestibility. The inner bark yields a tough fibre used in ropes and for weaving mats and yields a yellow dye (Blood 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Known to grow in open woodlands and on the edge of native woodlands, and urban bushland, and other vegetation. Also a weed of woodlands, urban rivers, and forests (DPI, NSW 2019). Naturalised in the sub-coastal districts of NSW (Queensland Government 2016).\n\nUrban areas: Where it is planted as an ornamental or street tree, plants can germinate in gardens and parkland ad if left can become large problematic woody weeds.",
    "controlMethods": "For European Nettle Tree (Celtis australis), there is no specific information available on control, however, techniques used for other weedy tree species are likely to be successful, such as physical removal and treatment with herbicides by stem injection and cut stump application.\n\nChemical control: Herbicide control is effective using the cut stump, basal bark or stem injection techniques. The method used depends on the site situation, tree size, access and personal preferences.

    "habitat": "Chinese Shrub is a drought-resistant Australian native shrub of temperate areas which colonises poor, often acidic, skeletal (very shallow) soils after other vegetation is disturbed by clearing or overgrazing and often forms dense stands (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChinese Shrub grows in disturbed soil in pastures, on stock routes, disturbed rangelands, roadsides, quarries, abandoned mines (e.g. areas disturbed by gold-mining), cemeteries, non-arable rural land and other cleared areas. It grows naturally on a variety of soils, often on dry, poor stony ground, in a wide variety of natural habitats (often as an understorey shrub), including eucalypt open forest, woodlands, mallee, Mugga Ironbark communities (on ridges with shallow stony soils), Black Box communities (on floodplains with grey clay soils), Grey Box and White Cypress communities (on loamy soils), Acacia scrub and on creek banks (Cooke 1986; Cunningham et al. 1992; Campbell et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; National Herbarium of New South Wales 2008).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Chinese Shrub was used on the Australian goldfields (in Victoria in the 1850s) by Chinese miners as roofing material for their huts, which gave rise to the common names Chinese Shrub or Chinese Scrub. Flowering branches are used in dried floral arrangements, and chopped stems are an effective filtering material in removing odours in some industrial processes (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChinese Shrub is a native species but it establishes readily when natural vegetation such as forest or woodland is cleared. It can form dense stands and become a weed colonising cleared or overgrazed land and disturbed soil on roadsides, abandoned mines and pastures (Cooke 1986; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nAgriculture: It grows well on land cleared for grazing and can dominate establishing pastures, increasing noticeably after periods of drought when other pasture species are weakened (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlants are unpalatable to stock and therefore the carrying capacity of heavily infested areas is very low (e.g. it can be reduced by as much as 90% in regions producing fine wool), although it may provide some forage in times of drought. When grazed, it is suspected of being poisonous to lambs, ewes and cows, and causing dermatitis in sheep (Campbell et al. 1998; Cunningham et al. 1992; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nClumps of the weed are a fire hazard and provide harbour for pest animals, particularly rabbits (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Chinese Shrub can form dense stands that compete very strongly with other native species for light and moisture, thus preventing regeneration of a more useful cover (Cunningham et al. 1992). How Chinese Shrub impacts natural areas should be assessed with care, and take into consideration that Chinese Shrub is part of natural ecosystems. Its ability to effectively colonise areas after disturbance is part of its natural role in vegetation succession and regeneration (Kodela & Benson 2008, pers. comm.).\n\nBecause it readily colonises disturbed and bare soils, Chinese Shrub has some use in the reclamation of gravel pits or mine dumps (Cunningham et al. 1992).",
    "controlMethods": "Scattered small plants of Chinese Shrub can be removed by chipping or pulling (if soil is moist) before they flower, taking care to minimise soil disturbance. This can then be followed by broadcasting pasture seed and fertiliser in the disturbed area to avoid reinfestation (Campbell et al. 1998).\n\nNon-chemical control: In the agricultural context small plants can be effectively killed by cultivation while large plants need to be cut or removed mechanically and burnt before cultivation. After an initial ploughing, a fallow period with several cultivations is necessary to kill seedlings and regrowth, before the area is sown to a suitable pasture. Moderate grazing in the first few years of pasture growth helps the pasture become established and survive. Grazing and trampling by animals, as well as competition from pasture species, will generally control any seedlings of Chinese Shrub that do emerge (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Maintaining strong pasture growth and avoiding over-grazing will discourage reinfestation (Southern Tablelands and South Coast Noxious Plants Committee undated).\n\nMechanical control: Slashing can provide control if carried out from mid-February to mid-March, after which pasture seed and fertiliser should be broadcast over the area in August. With slashing, it is necessary to cut below the lowest branch. Slashing is more damaging to plants over 1 m high, particularly if undertaken in dry weather. Slashing is likely to be necessary for at least two successive years to control regrowth, and should be restricted to flat land or gentle slopes with few large rocks. Dragging a heavy object over the plants in paddocks also kills many of them (Curnow et al. 1978; Campbell et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nLand management: In pastures, control programs should encourage strong clover growth to increase soil fertility, and strong growth of grasses to compete with weed seedlings. Using phosphorus encourages clovers while lime depresses the growth of Chinese Shrub seedlings (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nBurning: Burning on non-arable land removes mature plants but there will be seedling growth and regrowth from crowns (where stems and roots join), in which case chemical control, combined with aerial application of pasture seed and fertiliser might be appropriate (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). There are various control processes using burning practices, often combined with pasture competition (Campbell et al. 1998).\n\nChemical control: There are various potential chemical controls, but users should take into consideration possible impacts on pasture species or nearby native species such as eucalypts (Southwood 1970; Cook & Smith 1985; Plater 1993; Campbell et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nSee the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "Chinese Shrub is a native of south-eastern Australia and Western Australia and has probably not spread far beyond its natural range (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "similarSpecies": "Chinese Shrub may be confused with other species of Cassinia with short, narrow leaves, as well as other native daisy genera (e.g. Ozothamnus) and even non-daisy native shrubs when flowers are not present. It is usually able to be distinguished by its small leaves with a curry-like aroma and its often drooping plumes of brownish flowerheads. Cassinia theodori from the Nandewar Range, New South Wales, is closely related to (and could be a variant of) Cassinia arcuata, but differs in its leaves and stems being conspicuously grey or white with woolly hairs (Everett 1992). Specimens of Chinese Shrub may also be confused with Dolly Bush, also known as Common Cassinia or Dogwood, Cassinia aculeata (differs by having creamy white flowers); Cassinia adunca (differs by having creamy white flowers); Cassinia cunninghamii (differs by having bright yellow flowers); Cough Bush, Cassinia laevis (differs by having creamy white flowers); Cassinia ochracea (differs by having straw-coloured flowers); Sifton Bush, Cassinia quinquefaria (differs by having creamy white to straw-coloured flowers) and Sticky Cassinia, Cassinia uncata (differs by having creamy white flowers) which may have superficially similar-looking but usually longer leaves. Another difference is that many Cassinia species have their flowerheads arranged in more compact, almost flat-topped clusters, rather like a small cauliflower, instead of in pyramidal-shaped clusters (Auld & Medd 1992; Cunningham et al. 1992; Everett 1992; Puttock 1999; Southern Tablelands and South Coast Noxious Plants Committee undated).",

It prefers improved pasture, neglected areas and areas of animal or mechanical disturbance within this climatic zone. It also invades dry coastal vegetation, mallee shrubland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland and rock outcrop vegetation following disturbance. Both the Slender Thistles (C. pycnocephalus and C. tenuiflorus) are often found growing together (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Slender Thistle (Carduus tenuiflorus) is a weed of disturbed sites, and mainly occur in agricultural areas, where they invade pasture, crops and neglected areas with fertile soils and high rainfall.\n\nAgriculture: In pastoral areas, Slender Thistle (Carduus tenuiflorus) forms dense patches of spiny plants and may occupy considerable areas of pasture out-competing desirable pasture species and reducing carrying capacity. The spines can also deter stock. There is some suspicion that that the leaves may develop compounds harmful to livestock in some circumstances (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; TPIPWE 2019). Slender Thistle seedlings compete with pasture and crops and reduce productivity. Slender Thistles are not readily grazed by stock because of their spines, and infestations of slender thistle will discourage animals from grazing pasture grass adjacent to infestations. Slender Thistle impacts on the trade of agricultural products between states. If products (e.g. fodder, wool or pasture and crop seeds) are contaminated with seed of this weed, the product is devalued and in some cases prohibited from sale (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; TPIPWE 2019).\nNative ecosystems: It is invasive in disturbed areas of grassland, shrubland and woodland along tracks and areas of animal disturbance (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; TPIPWE 2019). It also invades dry coastal vegetation, mallee shrubland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland and rock outcrop vegetation following disturbance (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\nUrban areas: May invade roadsides and grassy areas.",
    "controlMethods": "There is considerable information available on integrated control of the Slender Thistles (Carduus pycnocephalus and C. tenuiflorus). See particularly Faithfull (1998) and DPIPWE (2019). If you have slender thistles, eradicate them before they set seed, as with all annual plants reproducing via seed. The best control of Slender Thistle (Carduus tenuiflorus) is obtained by integrated management\n\nChemical control: Control via herbsides are used either via hand held applications or via boom spraying. Please see DPIPWE (2019b) for Slender Thistles (Carduus tenuiflorus or  the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au for control of thistles.\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand remove isolated or small populations plants through spring and early summer.\nCultivation of the soil will encourage germination that can be followed up with herbicide application.\nPasture management: The best control is obtained by integrated pasture management to produce a vigorous and dense sward of pasture grasses during the main germination period in autumn to prevent successful rosette establishment. The traditional approach to pasture improvement of applying super-phosphate tends to encourage slender thistles and worsens the infestation. In heavily infested arable areas growing a cereal crop for one or two consecutive seasons can reduce the thistle population provided a suitable spray program is used (TPIPWE 2019).\nGrubbing: where the number of plants involved is small, removal by grubbing is feasible. The thistle should be grubbed out (This method requires weeds to be dug out using a mattock or chip hoe) to a depth of at least 5 cm. \nSlashing: The slashing or cutting will not generally kill Slender Thistles. However, cutting or slashing when the plants are in the late bud or early flower stage, in late spring to early summer, can prevent or reduce the production or spread of seed (TPIPWE 2019).\nGrazing management, Goats will graze Slender Thistles at the flowering stage, eating flowers, seed heads and stems. Over a period of several seasons this prevention of seed production can produce a significant reduction in thistle numbers (TDPI PWE 2019).\nBiological control: Slender Thistle has been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Use of rust fungi for biological control is currently being evaluated with the release of new rust strains to replace the ineffective strains that have been present in the country since the early twentieth century (TPIPWE 2019).",

C. tenuiflorus  has broad stem-wings extending up to the base of the clusters of flower-heads, absent from C. pycnocephalus. The flowerheads of C. tenuiflorus occur in clusters of 3-10 while C. pycnocephalus has only 1-4 per cluster. The phyllaries (floral bracts) of each head are scarcely cobwebby or lacking hairs altogether compared with the densely cobwebby phyllaries of C. pycnocephalus and the flowers are mostly shorter than the phyllaries (longer in C. pycnocephalus). C. tenuiflorus also has shorter seeds with less longitudinal grooves (Navie 2004; Slee 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nTwo other species of Carduus, C. nutans and C. thoermeri  also occur in Australia as weeds. Both are more robust plants than C. pycnocephalus and C. tenuiflorus with larger diameter rosettes, coarser stems and leaves with larger flowerheads that frequently nod at a right angle to the stem (Navie 2004; Slee 2007, pers. comm.).",

It is found on moderately to highly fertile soils in areas with predominantly winter rainfall, with annual rainfall in excess of 500 mm. It prefers improved pasture, neglected areas and areas of animal or mechanical disturbance within this climatic zone. It also invades dry coastal vegetation, mallee shrubland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland and rock outcrop vegetation following disturbance (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Slender Thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus) is a weed of disturbed sites, and mainly occur in agricultural areas, where they invade pasture, crops and neglected areas with fertile soils and high rainfall.\n\nAgriculture: In pastoral areas Slender Thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus) forms dense patches of spiny plants and may occupy considerable areas of pasture out-competing desirable pasture species and reducing carrying capacity. The spines can also deter stock. There is some suspicion that that the leaves may develop compounds harmful to livestock in some circumstances (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; TPIPWE 2019). Slender thistle seedlings compete with pasture and crops and reduce productivity. Slender thistles are not readily grazed by stock because of their spines, and infestations of slender thistle will discourage animals from grazing pasture grass adjacent to infestations. Slender Thistle impacts on the trade of agricultural products between states. If products (e.g. fodder, wool or pasture and crop seeds) are contaminated with seed of this weed, the product is devalued and in some cases prohibited from sale (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; TPIPWE 2019).\n\nNative ecosystems: It is invasive in disturbed areas of grassland, shrubland and woodland along tracks and areas of animal disturbance (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; TPIPWE 2019). It also invades dry coastal vegetation, mallee shrubland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland and rock outcrop vegetation following disturbance (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nUrban areas: May invade roadsides and grassy areas.",
    "controlMethods": "There is considerable information available on integrated control of the Slender Thistles (Carduus pycnocephalus and C. tenuiflorus). See particularly Faithfull (1998) and DPIPWE (2019). If you have slender thistles, eradicate them before they set seed, as with all annual plants reproducing via seed.\n\nChemical control: Control via herbsides are used either via hand held applications or via boom spraying. Please see DPIPWE (2019b) for Slender Thistles (Carduus pycnocephalus or  the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au for control of thistles.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand remove isolated or small populations plants through spring and early summer.\n\nCultivation of the soil will encourage germination that can be followed up with herbicide application.\n\nPasture management: The best control is obtained by integrated pasture management to produce a vigorous and dense sward of pasture grasses during the main germination period in autumn to prevent successful rosette establishment. The traditional approach to pasture improvement of applying superphosphate tends to encourage slender thistles and worsens the infestation. In heavily infested arable areas growing a cereal crop for one or two consecutive seasons can reduce the thistle population provided a suitable spray program is used (TPIPWE 2019).\n\nGrubbing: where the number of plants involved is small, removal by grubbing is feasible. The thistle should be grubbed out (This method requires weeds to be dug out using a mattock or chip hoe) to a depth of at least 5 cm.\n\nSlashing: The Slashing or cutting will not generally kill Slender Thistles. However, cutting or slashing when the plants are in the late bud or early flower stage, in late spring to early summer, can prevent or reduce the production or spread of seed (TPIPWE 2019).\n\nGrazing management, Goats will graze Slender Thistles at the flowering stage, eating flowers, seed heads and stems. Over a period of several seasons this prevention of seed production can produce a significant reduction in thistle numbers (TDPI PWE 2019).\n\nBiological control: Slender Thistle has been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Use of rust fungi for biological control is currently being evaluated with the release of new rust strains to replace the ineffective strains that have been present in the country since the early twentieth century (TPIPWE 2019).",

    "similarSpecies": "Carduus pycnocephalus is difficult to distinguish from its sister species Carduus tenuiflorus. C. tenuiflorus has broad stem-wings extending up to the base of the clusters of flower-heads, absent from C. pycnocephalus. The flowerheads of C. tenuiflorus occur in clusters of 3-10 (1-4 in C. pycnocephalus), the phyllaries (floral bracts) of each head are scarcely cobwebby or lacking hairs altogether and the flowers are mostly shorter than the phyllaries (longer in C. pycnocephalus). C. tenuiflorus also has shorter seeds with less longitudinal grooves (Navie 2004; Slee 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nTwo other species of Carduus, C. nutans and C. thoermeri  occur in Australia as weeds also. Both are more robust plants than C. pycnocephalus and C. tenuiflorus with larger diameter rosettes, coarser stems and leaves with larger flowerheads that frequently nod at a right angle to the stem (Navie 2004; Slee 2007, pers. comm.).",

The presence of disturbed sites in pastures and native grasslands at the end of summer favours its establishment. Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) has an absolute requirement for vernalization (chilling) before it can flower therefore requires cold winters (Popay & Medd 1990; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "In Australia, Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) has proven to be an aggressive competitor of pastures. It occurs in dense patches and is not readily grazed by most stock because of its spiny foliage. Its presence also discourages animals from grazing other neighbouring pasture plants and it can affect the movement of stock.\n\nAgriculture: In pastoral areas Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) forms dense patches of spiny plants and may occupy considerable areas of pasture out-competing desirable pasture species and reducing carrying capacity. The spines deter stock and thistle exudates restrict growth of nearby pasture (Popay & Medd 1990; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nSeed production is high and seed longevity is habitat dependent being up to about 7 years in bare or cultivated ground and up to about 13 years in pasture (Popay & Medd 1990; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems: In native grasslands it is invasive in disturbed areas along tracks and areas of animal disturbance and can persist if unchecked (Popay & Medd 1990; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nUrban areas: May invade roadsides and grassy areas. Known to have invaded a grassy air strip in Western Australia.",
    "controlMethods": "It is difficult to control because of its long flowering season, prolific seed production, the longevity of its seed bank, a variable life cycle, and the ability to germinate at any time of the year provided there is moisture available. The best defence against invasion of Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) on agricultural lands is maintaining healthy perennial pasture with good ground cover in summer going into autumn to prevent seedling establishment. With existing infestations control will depend on acreage infested and weed density.\n\nChemical control: Herbicide application in springtime when the first buds are obvious in the centre of the rosette has been shown to be effective. The least satisfactory time of application of herbicides is mid-winter, and when the stems are elongating (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Dellow 1996). Springtime non-lethal herbicide application combined with grazing is the best of the integrated strategies (Shea et al. 2006).\n\nAn infestation may contain plants at various stages, including seedlings, small rosettes, large rosettes, flower-stem growth, and full flower and the type of herbicide used will depend on the stages of growth in an infestation. The best time to spray nodding thistle is when the plant is in the seedling and small rosette stage. Control of an infestation in pasture may require spraying in spring and autumn.\n\nResistance of Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) to some herbicides has been shown to develop in New Zealand with continued use. The only effective means of avoiding the development of resistance is to reduce dependence on herbicides for control, especially by using pasture management to reduce weed establishment in summer going into autumn (Harrington 1996). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand remove isolated plants or small populations through spring and early summer.\n\nCultivation of the soil will encourage germination that can be followed up with herbicide application.\n\nGrubbing: where the number of plants involved is small, removal by grubbing is feasible. The thistle should be grubbed out ( This method requires weeds to be dug out using a mattock or chip hoe) to a depth of at least 5 cm.\n\nSlashing: The Slashing or cutting of plants in bud or then early flowering stage can be used to delay flowering or seeding, but will likely result in additional stem growth (coppicing) from the stem or rootstock, and must be followed up by measures to kill the whole plant. If the plant is in full flower, heads should be collected and burnt since seed may mature on the cut stalks.\n\nGrazing management, Grazing by goats has been shown to be effective against Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) as they selectively graze flower-heads and heads setting seed and thus can reduce overall seed-set. They rarely graze rosettes. Sheep grazing is an ineffective control method (Holst & Allan 1996). A combination of seasonal 'crash-grazing', in either autumn or spring, at up to four times the normal grazing pressure, combined with biological control agents, is highly effective (Shea et al. 2006).\n\nBiological control: Nodding Thistle (Carduus nutans) has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Three biocontrol agents (one a Root-crown Weevil Trichosirocalus mortadelo, and two flowerhead feeding insects Urophora solstitialis and Rhinocyllus conicus) have been released in an effort to control Nodding Thistle. The Root-crown Weevil is the most effective as it attacks a life stage critical to the thistle's invasive success in Australia while the seed feeders do not (Shea et al. 2006).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Balloon Vine (Cardiospermum grandiflorum) climbs up trees and over other vegetation for support, smothering them and preventing photosynthesis.  Balloon vine (Cardiospermum grandiflorum) is a significant environmental weed in eastern New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland, and is currently listed as a priority environmental weed in four Natural Resource Management Regions. This species is also one of the exotic vines that has resulted in \"invasion of exotic vines and scramblers\" being declared a \"key threatening process\" in New South Wales.\n\nAgriculture: Balloon Vine could invade orchards and other horticultural crops or forestry.\n\nNative ecosystems:  Balloon vine grows rapidly into the tops of trees and can smother and kill trees, shrubs and ground-cover plants. It forms a thick curtain of stems and leaves which excludes light and inhibits photosynthesis in the native plants below. Infestations start at the edge of forests where the weight of the Balloon Vine growing en-masse can cause the whole forest edge or canopy to collapse and results in further infestations and ecosystem destruction over time. This increases light availability and disturbs the soil surface creating ideal conditions for the growth of more Balloon Vine and other weed species (McClymont 1997; Muyt 2001; Land Protection 2006). It is common along creeks, near the margins of rainforests, and in moist gullies in the coastal districts of Queensland and New South Wales. It also grows along disturbed creek-lines in south-western Western Australia and in and around Adelaide in South Australia. Balloon vine can be seen growing in most of the riverine rainforest remnants around Brisbane. These rainforest remnants are small and any reduction of their edges exposes them to greater risk of weed invasion and a number of other threats.\n\nUrban areas: May invade roadsides and grassy areas and invade abandoned or little cared for gardens.",
    "controlMethods": "While infestations of Balloon Vine (Cardiospermum grandiflorum) may appear daunting, they can be effectively controlled by physical removal, or chemical treatment. The spread of this plant should be contained to prevent further impacting of other vegetation.\n\nChemical control: Control via systemic herbicides is an option for larger plants that cannot be removed by hand. The use of herbicide spray may be an option when used with the correct equipment on large plants. Foliar spraying seedlings with herbicide if there are no native plants nearby. and using this method on infestations climbing over desirable species may result in off- target damage so other methods should be employed. Young and mature plants can be scraped and painted with herbicide to kill them. Older vines with very large stems can be injected with herbicide or the cut and swab (cut and paint) method can be used with a systemic herbicide.  Do not pull the vine from large infestation on large trees as it may damage native vegetation and any other small fauna in the tree. Remove and dispose of all seeds. Follow-up treatment will be required for new seedlings. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand remove individual or groups of small seedlings. These can be hand pulled making sure the tap root is removed. For larger plants / vines the stems can be cut and the tap root removed, followed at a later date with the removal of the dried out vegetation in the canopy. This method may be difficult due to the height of the infestation. Again, do not pull the vine from large infestation on large trees as it may damage native vegetation and any other small fauna in the tree. Follow up is critical over the following 18 months to prevent regrowth from residual tap roots and seedling emergence post disturbance. A catchment wide approach can be beneficial when controlling Balloon Vine to prevent spread and re-colonisation along waterways (Muyt 2001; Land Protection 2006; Harley 2007).",

Calotrope hinders pastoralism by reducing the productivity of rangeland pastures and making mustering more difficult (Navie & Adkins 2007). It forms dense thickets on alluvial floodplains and then spreads into adjacent over-grazed pastures (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It thrives on poor soils, particularly where overgrazing has removed competition from native grasses, and forms dense thickets which compete with native plant species and transform the appearance of grassland plant communities (Smith 2002).\n\nCalotrope is currently listed as a priority environmental weed in three Natural Resource Management Regions and is being actively managed by community groups in the Northern Territory (Navie & Adkins 2007).",

    "habitat": "Heather is suited to dry and nutrient poor conditions. It is also very frost hardy and can grow in wet conditions. In its native region, it exhibits a wide climatic tolerance and can be found growing at altitudes ranging from sea level through to nearly 2,700 m (Gimingham 1960). It generally grows in open habitats and prefers acidic soils. It is a component of many different vegetation types, especially grasslands, lowland and upland heath, moors and bogs, open woodland, sand dunes and partially stabilised scree (Gimingham 1960).\n\nUnder some circumstances, the regeneration and dominance of Heather is encouraged by fire, which promotes vigorous growth of seedlings and regrowth from old stems (Webb 1989; Legg et al. 1992). However, severe or frequent fires may lead to a substantial depletion of soil stored seed and, in some cases, may completely destroy the seed bank (Legg et al. 1992). Many western European heaths dominated by Heather were once forested areas. Clear-felling of the forest has paved the way for heathlands that have been maintained by burning at regular intervals, principally to maintain habitat for grouse and sheep (Gimingham 1960; Webb 1989).\n\nIn Tasmania, Heather has been recorded in various different habitats including alpine vegetation in the Central Highlands, weedy roadside vegetation in highly productive inland pastoral areas and on poor pasture and roadsides on sandy soils near the coast (Baker & Hanson 2006; Crane pers. comm. 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Heather is on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 non-native plants that threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage. Although only in the early stages of establishment, these weeds have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems (CRC 2003).\n\nHeather has the potential to be a significant environmental weed in temperate Australia and could invade a variety of communities in lowland and upland areas, especially after disturbance such as fire or clear felling. Overseas, it has transformed tussock communities and invaded a variety of vegetation types, including native heaths, grasslands and open forest. Each of these vegetation types exists in Australia and some are particularly vulnerable. In addition, the plant can be expected to change fire regimes in natural ecosystems by altering the nature of fuel loads. It may also provide habitat for pest animals such as rabbits.\n\nHeather is a significant weed in large areas of New Zealand where it is especially problematic in the North Island's Tongariro National Park World Heritage Area. It was intentionally introduced to the park in 1912 and it now has the distinction of being the Park's most widespread and invasive weed. It is the dominant cover in around 1000 ha and is present in another 25 000 ha (Keys & Syrett 1995).\n\nThe economic impact of Heather in Australia is mostly relevant to natural areas and roadsides, where its establishment would lead to greater cost burdens associated with control and removal. It may also have some impact on eco-tourism values (Baker & Hanson 2006). Whilst unlikely to invade cultivated land or well-managed pasture, incursions in unimproved pasture may lead to reduced profitability (CRC 2003).\n\nMature Heather is highly competitive by virtue of its wide environmental tolerance, high reproductive capacity and its ability to form dense canopies that exclude other species. It is also thought that Heather releases allelopathic compounds that inhibit growth of surrounding plants, particularly trees (Matthews 1993).",
    "controlMethods": "Due to the plant's limited distribution as a weed in Australia, there has been little scope for research into successful control methods.\n\nIts fibrous root system makes manual control by hand pulling or digging difficult. Also, the soil disturbance associated with such manual control usually results in regrowth from stem fragments and seed (CRC 2003). Intense grazing by sheep, especially in spring, will suppress the growth and subsequent flowering of Heather and may even result in the elimination the plant after a number of years (Gimingham 1960). Light grazing and mechanical slashing encourage Heather to put on new growth but will not kill the plants (CRC 2003). In New Zealand, herbicide is used to control Heather; however, there are no herbicides currently registered for use on Heather in Australia (CRC 2003).\n\nHeather responds well to sporadic non-intense fires that rejuvenate older plants and stimulate the germination of soil stored seed (Gimingham 1960; Webb 1989, Legg et al. 1992).\n\nThe potential for biological control of Heather in New Zealand has been investigated since the late 1980s (Syrett 1995). Unfortunately the beetle predator released for this purpose in 1996 has had minimal impact (CRC 2003).\n\nA range of integrated control methods, coupled with routine follow-up monitoring and control, will need to be carried out for several years to successfully manage infestations of Heather.\n\nControl of Heather should not be undertaken without specialist advice and assistance from your local council, or state or territory weed management agency.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "Heather is a cool temperate, oceanic and sub-oceanic species that is native over much of Europe, with only outlying populations in south-eastern Europe (Gimingham 1960). It is also native in northern Africa, the Azores and the Madeira Islands (Weber 2003).",
    "growthForm": "Shrub",

The following characters should serve to distinguish Heather from Erica species: the sepals of Heather are petal-like and pink as opposed to the sepals of Erica species which are usually green. The leaves of Heather overlap each other and are sessile, whilst the leaves of Erica species are stalked and not strongly overlapping.",

    "impact": "Agriculture: Dense patches of Spiny Broom reduce the area available for grazing, limit stock access to watering points and provide refuge for pest animals.

Spiny Broom is rated a serious threat to native vegetation in lowland grassland, grassy woodland and dry sclerophyll forest in Victoria (Carr et al. 1992).",
    "controlMethods": "A long-term strategic program is required to effectively control Spiny Broom, concentrating on exhausting the seed bank and preventing further additions to it. New infestations should be treated before plants reach the flowering stage. Once plants start to produce seeds, control becomes more difficult and dispersal to other areas is likely. Soil disturbance and fire will stimulate germination of seed in the soil and further treatment over two or three years will be needed to kill the resulting seedlings (Muyt 2001).\n\nChemical control: Where chemical control is needed a suitable herbicide can be applied to actively growing plants in full leaf before flowering (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nFor chemical information, see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, available at http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Seedlings and smaller plants can be dug out (Muyt 2001). Larger plants or plants in clumps can be grubbed out with a bulldozer or tractor and chain, taking care to remove most of the rootstock because it can resprout. Grubbed clumps can be ploughed to bring roots to the surface so they can be burned (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

These include weedy and/or introduced Genista and Cytisus species. The stiff, spine-tipped side branches (10-40 mm long) of Spiny Broom should readily distinguish it from these species (Reid 2008 pers. obs.).\n\nCamel Thorn (Alhagi maurorum) is a smaller shrub, also with spine-tipped side branches, but these are finer and a greyer green than Spiny Broom. The flowers of Camel Thorn are mainly red and purple rather than plain yellow as in Spiny Broom (Jeanes 1996; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Reid 2008 pers. obs.).\n\nGorse (Ulex europaeus) is also a spiny shrub with yellow pea flowers. It differs from Spiny Broom in having spines more densely distributed along the main branches, no leaves on mature plants and relatively short (10-20 mm) densely hairy pods (Jeanes 1996; Muyt 2001; Reid 2008 pers. obs.).\n\nFor further information and assistance with identification of Spiny Broom, contact the herbarium in your state or territory.",

    "controlMethods": "Chemical control: Mysore Thorn can be controlled by herbicide application which is most effective when plants are actively growing and prior to flowering (PIER 2006; Rolles 2006). Adequate application of herbicide on Mysore Thorn in dense infestations is difficult and repeated applications every 3–9 months allows gradual reductions and opening of the canopy and eventual control. This strategy not only stresses the Mysore Thorn over a longer period but also controls newly germinated seedlings (PIER 2006).\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical control: Is only useful on  small plants and seedlings that can be manually pulled or hoed from the ground. All roots should be removed if pulling by hand. Larger plants and infestations are difficult to treat manually. The thorny habit and ability to rapidly re-shoot from cut stems, makes mechanical control challenging (NSW Weedwise 2018)\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

The elongated flower clusters are somewhat hairy and the flowers are 10-15 mm long.\n\nWhile Dwarf Poinciana has compound leaves, each leaf has numerous pairs of branchlets and this species is also distinct from Mysore Thorn by being thornless. It has yellow flowers with very long stamens with distinctive bright red filaments. The elongated flower clusters are covered in sticky hairs and the flowers are 20-25 mm long.\n\nPride of Barbados is a prickly plant that has compound leaves bearing numerous pairs of branchlets. Its bright yellow, orange and yellow, or red and yellow flowers have very long stamens with yellow or bright red filaments. The elongated flower clusters are hairless and the showy flowers are more than 25 mm long.\n\nHoney Locust is a spiny plant that has compound leaves bearing several pairs of branchlets. Unlike Mysore Thorn it has very small, inconspicuous greenish or creamy-yellow flowers with small hairy stamens.\n\nParkinsonia (Parkinsonia aculeata) is a spiny plant that has compound leaves bearing a few pairs of long strap-like branchlets.

    "reproduction": "",
    "habitat": "Cabomba grows in still or slow-moving freshwater, in ponds, lakes, dams, channels and quiet streams. It is sensitive to drying out and requires permanent shallow water, usually less than 3 m, but up to 10 m, deep. It grows well on a silty bed, but less well on hard surfaces. It grows quickly and so can respond to wide fluctuations in water depth (CRC 2003).\n\nCabomba grows well in high nutrient environments with a low pH; in more alkaline waters it tends to lose its leaves. High calcium levels also inhibit growth. Unlike other aquatic weeds, Cabomba can grow well in turbid water. It prefers a warm, humid climate with a temperature range of 13–27 ºC but can survive when the surface of the water body is frozen (CRC 2003).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Cabomba is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nCabomba is choking waterways along Australia’s east coast (CRC 2003). Cabomba grows quickly and can therefore block slow-moving waterways such as irrigation channels, ponds, dams and lakes (Richardson et al. 2006), significantly reducing storage capacity by siltation (Faithfull & Gunasekera 1999, Land Protection 2006). It also decreases water quality by causing colouring, odours, accumulation of organic matter and stagnation in streams (Ensbey 2000, CRC 2003).\n\nCabomba is an aggressive invader of native freshwater systems, particularly if they are nutrient rich, excluding native plant species by blocking out sunlight and competing for space and nutrients. It can also have a negative impact on native fish, aquatic invertebrates, birds, reptiles and other animals (CRC 2003, CSIRO Entomology 2004, Land Protection 2006; NRETA undated). At the same time, it can create a suitable habitat for mosquito breeding (NRETA undated).\n\nDense infestations of Cabomba degrade the aesthetic value of streams (Ensbey 2000) and impede aquatic transport and recreational activities such as swimming, diving and boating (Ensbey 2000, CRC 2003, Land Protection 2006).",
    "controlMethods": "Once established, Cabomba is extremely difficult to control, so prevention is therefore the best means of control. This requires community awareness for early detection and notification of any stands. The spread of Cabomba in Australia has also been aided by the deliberate ‘seeding’ of waterways to ensure a wild supply for the aquarium trade (CRC 2003). Some strategies to help prevent spread include the following:\n\nDispose of Cabomba from aquariums responsibly, e.g., by drying and burning the entire plant.\nEducate people to use other species of aquarium plants\nLocal agencies need to be able to close waterways to prevent spread\nDevelop protocols for washdown of boats, trailers and fishing equipment before they leave an infested site (CRC 2003).\n\nPhysical control: cutting and removal is suited to accessible areas of closed water bodies with established heavy infestations. However, Cabomba grows so quickly that treatment is only likely to maintain a clear water surface for a few weeks and the cost is high. Hand pulling by divers is best suited to isolated plants and small areas (CRC 2003).\n\nThe deliberate lowering of the water level (drawdown) may be the best option for drinking water supplies. If the base of the water storage dries out completely there is little chance of Cabomba surviving, but if it remains damp there is a more than 50% chance it will return. Because Cabomba requires direct sunlight, shading has been used to kill it in small areas. However, the cost is prohibitive for large-scale programs. Long-term benefits are expected from maintaining tree coverage along the edges of creeks and rivers to discourage Cabomba establishing in the shallows (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: is difficult because of the problems associated with applying chemicals in water and the potential to affect non-target species. It has also shown some resistance to herbicides (CRC 2003). See the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information at http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nBiological control: has not yet been attempted although some research has been conducted (Mackey & Swarbrick 1998, Julien & Schooler 2004). An active biocontrol research program for cabomba (Cabomba caroliniana A. Gray) is currently led by CSIRO Australia and supported by the Rural Research and Development for Profit program in Australia (Harvey et al., 2023).\n\nFor further information see CRC (2003) and the NRETA (undated).",
    "origin": "There are five species of Cabomba, from tropical and warm temperate areas of the Americas (North, Central and South America) and the West Indies (Stanley & Orchard 2007). None is native to Australia.\n\nCabomba is native to eastern USA, southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and north-eastern Argentina (Stanley & Orchard 2007). It has been spread throughout the world by the aquarium trade (CRC 2003) and is now naturalised, usually from discarded aquarium plants, in many countries, including Australia and New Guinea (Stanley & Orchard 2007).",
    "growthForm": "Aquatic, Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Cabomba may be easily confused with other aquatic species, notably the Hornworts (Ceratophyllum species) and some Watermilfoils (Myriophyllum species). The closely related Pink Cabomba (Cabomba furcata) is also sold as an aquarium plant. It is pink in colour with purple flowers and is not considered a weed in Australia (CRC 2003).\n\nNRETA (undated) provides a useful comparison guide between Cabomba and similar species. See http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/natres/weeds/ntweeds/Cabomba/species.html . Identification should be confirmed by experts.",

Mother of Millions is often associated with dry skeletal soils, rocky or stony sites and loose sandy soils, but it may be found in a wide variety of soils ranging from sand to heavy clays (Hannan-Jones & Playford 2002).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Mother of Millions and hybrid Mother of Millions were included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Mother of Millions and hybrid Mother of Millions were not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance, and is highly toxic to stock and humans.\n\nNative ecosystems: Both species are also regarded as significant environmental weeds in Queensland and New South Wales. They are well adapted to dry environments, are able to survive droughts, and can form very large infestations in grasslands and open woodlands in inland regions (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nMother of Millions is currently of most concern in southern and central Queensland, and in 2002 was ranked as the third most important environmental weed in south-eastern Queensland (Batianoff & Butler 2002). It is actively managed by community groups in Queensland and is listed as a priority environmental weed in eight Natural Resource Management regions in eastern Australia (Navie & Adkins 2007). In inland central Queensland, near Dingo, Mother of Millions is competing with and replacing the native herbs that make up the diet of the endangered Nail-tailed Wallaby (Onychogalea fraenata). In inland southern Queensland, it is one of four invasive plant species that is impacting on the endangered Isis Tamarind (Alectryon ramiflorus). It is also very invasive in sandy coastal sites, such as on foredunes and coastal islands. In one study it was found to be one of the twelve most invasive ornamental species on the foredunes of the Sunshine Coast (Hannan-Jones & Playford 2002).\n\nHybrid Mother of Millions is less common and widespread at present, and is currently of most concern in south-eastern Queensland. However, it was still recently ranked among the top 30 most invasive plants in this region. In New South Wales it is becoming increasingly common, particularly in the north-east of the state, and is also naturalised around the opal fields near Lightning Ridge (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nAgriculture: Mother of Millions and hybrid Mother of Millions are very poisonous to livestock and humans. Cattle deaths resulting from ingestion of these species are quite common, particularly in south-eastern Queensland (Hannan-Jones & Playford 2002). These species commonly invade rangelands and native pastures, replacing useful grasses and legumes, and significantly reducing the productivity of pastoral areas.\n\nNSW DPI (2019) staet that Mother of millions is toxic when ingested by livestock, it is also poisonous to humans and household pets. Ingestion of the toxins can be cumulative and livestock eating small amounts, several times within a few days may suffer poisoning. Eating about 5 kg of mother of millions would kill an adult cow. Where the plants are thick, this amount would grow in a square metre. Poisoning generally occurs when the plants are flowering – between May and October. Livestock are at a greater risk of poisoning if they have been moved to a new paddock, there is a feed shortage or during droving because they are more likely to eat the plant. If livestock have eaten a large amount of plant, they may die suddenly of heart failure. If they have eaten smaller amounts over several days, they may develop diarrhoea (sometimes bloody), drool saliva, dribble urine and then die of heart failure. Some affected livestock will recover slowly if small amounts of plant material have been eaten and their hearts are not badly damaged. Poisoned stock must be treated within 24 hours of consuming the plant. After this period heart function is severely disturbed and stock may be too badly affected to survive. If you suspect livestock could have mother of millions poisoning, consult a vet immediately.\n\nUrban areas: Mother of millions can become weedy in the drier gardens and little carried for gardens.  These plants can subsequently spread and jump the garden fence in to other areas. It is also toxic to humans and household pets with dogs being particularly susceptible. It is unlikely that humans or pets would eat enough plant material to become poisoned. However, because mother of millions can be found in many gardens, the likelihood of human or pet poisoning is increased (NSW DPI 2019).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Hand pulling of plants can be effective in small areas. However, all plant material should be stacked on a wood heap and burnt, or bagged and disposed of carefully, to prevent plant parts establishing new colonies.\n\nFire: Fire can be used to control larger infestations and this is often the most economical control measure. It kills Mother of Millions plants and also encourages grass competition. This can lessen the problem for several years and spot-spraying of survivors with selective herbicides at this time can provide very successful control.\n\nChemical control: Mother of Millions may be controlled with herbicides at any time of the year, but infestations are easiest to see in winter when the plants are in flower. However, treating infestations prior to seed development is important to prevent seed set and limit future seedling emergence (Land Protection 2007).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nBiological control: Mother of Millions has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.\n\nSouth African Citrus Thrips (Scirtothrips aurantii), which have been accidentally introduced into Australia, were noticed to be damaging Mother of Millions plants in the field in inland southern Queensland in 2003. Though this species is not a natural enemy of Mother of Millions, and is not even found in Madagascar, recent trials have indicated that it greatly impedes the growth and flowering of Mother of Millions. However, it may also have negative impacts on other important native and economic plant species and it is not being actively promoted as a control method until more information about its likely impacts are known (Cant 2007).\n\nPermanent control of Mother of Millions is best ensured by establishing more desirable plants that can compete successfully with Mother of Millions seedlings and plantlets. Scattered infestations and small dumping areas on properties should also be regularly checked and cleaned up to prevent re-invasion (Land Protection 2007).\n\nCheck with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for control of Mother of Millions and hybrid Mother of Millions.",
    "origin": "Mother of Millions is native to Madagascar, where it is more commonly found in the drier southern regions. It is sometimes also reported to be native to South Africa, but it is most likely naturalised there (Hannan-Jones & Playford 2002).\n\nHybrid Mother of Millions is possibly of horticultural origin. It is a hybrid of two species that are both native to Madagascar (Hannan-Jones & Playford 2002).",
    "growthForm": "Succulent",
    "similarSpecies": "Mother of Millions (Bryophyllum delagoense) is very similar to hybrid Mother of Millions (Bryophyllum x houghtonii) and the main difference between the two plants is in the shape of their leaves. Mother of Millions has cylindrical leaves with notched tips, while hybrid Mother of Millions has slightly broader boat-shaped leaves with teeth all along their margins.\n\nThese plants can also be confused with other Bryophyllum species. They are particularly similar to Mother of Thousands (Bryophyllum daigremontianum), the other parent plant of hybrid Mother of Millions. However, Mother of Thousands has larger boat-shaped or folded leaves that are often more than 10 cm long and 25 mm wide. The other Bryophyllum species (i.e. B. pinnatum, B. proliferum and B. fedtschenkoi) can usually be distinguished by their flatter and broader leaves, which are sometimes compound with three or more leaflets (Navie & Adkins 2007).",

    "habitat": "Giant Tropical Salvia prefers damp habitats and in Australia it has been found growing along the edges of waterways, in orchards, in nurseries and around sugarcane plantations. It is able to grow in shade. It also has the potential to colonise disturbed areas such as roadsides, agricultural clearings and gaps in forests in the coastal areas of Queensland from Brisbane north (Weed Society of Queensland 2006). It is likely to also pose a threat to the wetter areas of the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region of Western Australia (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Giant Tropical Salvia is one of seventeen sleeper weeds identified by the Bureau of Rural Sciences (following consultation with the Australian Weeds Committee) which could have nationally significant impacts on agriculture if allowed to spread.\n\nAgriculture: Giant Tropical Salvia is a known troublesome weed forming dense stands beneath tropical African crops such as Coffee, Oil-palm, Bananas and Rubber. In Australia it forms dense stands along waterways, thus blocking access and competing with native vegetation. Its preference is for wetter and shaded areas where it will eventually form dense mats of vegetation because of its sprawling habit. It is likely to cause similar problems to those caused by Chinese Violet (Asystasia gangetica) (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nNative ecosystems: Giant Tropical Salvia colonises recently disturbed land and occasionally forms large, monospecific stands. In Australia it has demonstrated a propensity to form dense stands along waterways. It causes serious impacts to riparian areas and other habitats in coastal areas, where it out-competes the native vegetation and impacts upon wildlife by reducing natural sources of food and shelter (Biosecurity Queensland 2016).",
    "controlMethods": "There is no information documented on the control of Giant Tropical Salvia but it is likely that it will be similar, if not identical, to that for Chinese Violet (Asystasia gangetica), which is regarded as difficult to control.\n\nAlthough viewed as a species where eradication is desirable it may not be feasible. Estimates for control of this species in 2006 where it was thought to be in 3 or 4 populations over 50 hectares were already given as $473,428 (Cunningham & Brown 2006). Eradication will be achieved by reduction of the seed bank and careful disposal of plants. Documentation of the biology of the species may provide some further insights into control measures.\n\nChemical control: Little is known about effective chemical control treatments. Advice could be sought from agencies that have had some experience in this area such as the Douglas Shire Council.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .",
    "origin": "Giant Tropical Salvia is native to wet forest regions of Africa, from Sierra Leone on the west coast to Ethiopia, almost on the eastern coast and then south to Tanzania and northern Angola. It has naturalized in Kenya and is quite capable of forming weedy populations in cleared areas or in plantations in areas where it is native (Sidwell 1998).",
    "growthForm": "Shrub",
    "similarSpecies": "Because of its 4 angled stems and 2-lipped flowers Giant Tropical Salvia is most likely to be confused with species in the Lamiaceae family such as Salvia or Plectranthus or possibly with some members of the Scrophulariaceae family. It is immediately distinguishable as being from the Acanthaceae family by the presence of cystoliths (calcium carbonate crystals which appear as whitish elongated streaks) in the stems and leaves and by the presence of prominent hooks under the seeds in the fruit which remain visible in the fruit after the seed has been lost. The flattened seeds also possess mucilaginous hairs which expand when the seed is introduced to water, a characteristic not found in Lamiaceae or Scrophulariaceae species (Barker 2007, pers. comm.). It may also be confused with closely related species such as native hypoestes (Hypoestes floribunda), ribbon plant (Hypoestes aristata) and polka-dot plant (Hypoestes phyllostachya) (Biosecurity Queensland 2016).",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Bifora (Bifora testiculata), is a weed a agriculture, with most infestations and  impacts known from South Australia (SA).\n\nAgriculture: In SA Bifora competes with cereals, grain legumes and field peas, reducing yields. It is also a contaminant reducing value and marketability of seed and hay. It therefore increases crop input costs and can limit the options for crop rotations even precluding the use of legumes (Government of South Australia 2015). Wherever it occurs in Australia, Bifora has become a major weed for farmers especially in grain legume crops, where it can substantially reduce harvest speed, grain quality and yields. The seeds of Bifora can germinate over periods of up to eight years and are difficult to control as there are few post-emergent herbicides that are cost effective or registered (Wissell & Moerkerk 2000; Holding & Bowcher 2004). Some herbicide weed control programs allows Bifora to gain a competitive advantage as a result of the selective removal of other broadleaf annual weeds (Black et al. 1994).\n\nNative ecosystems:  Not known as a weed of Native vegetation\n\nUrban areas: Biflora has been collected from urban areas so could become a weed of gardens and parks",

Bifora (Bifora testiculata) is best controlled prior to sowing and in early growth to minimise its impact on crop growth and yield. (Holding & Bowcher 2004). During drought the transfer of fodder and grain between states can result in the transfer of seed to other states. Therefore it is important to check for any occurrences of the weed, especially in areas where stock have been fed (Department of Primary Industry and Water, Tasmania 2007; NSW DPI 2007; NSW Government 2017).\n\nChemical control:  Bifora forms a significant seed bank in the soil as only about 25% of seed germinates in the first year (Government of South Australia 2015). Chemical control applied early post-emergence resulted in a 90% control of Bifora in wheat and barley crops. Pre-emergent and late post-emergent applications were not as effective (Black et al. 1994). Effective control of the weed in preceding cereal crops to reduce the soil seed bank was found to minimise the problem in following field pea crops (Black et al. 1994).  Effective herbicide treatments exist for bifora in cereals, with mixtures containing carfentrazone-ethyl giving the most reliable control. Control in pulse crops is more difficult, and there is no cost-effective control in field peas (Government of South Australia 2015).  for control with chemical in South Australia, see the Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical control: cultivation will stimulate germination of some of the seed bank.",

African Thistle invades natural areas of forest, woodland, dune shrubland, coastal scrub e.g. in rocky foreshore areas and grassland (DPIPWE 2019; Lamp & Collet 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Thompson Berrill Landscape Design Pty Ltd 2006; Western Australian Herbarium 1998-).",

    "impact": "African Thistle has no feed value, as its spines make it unpalatable to stock. It can form large colonies, consisting of matted stems. To date, it remains close to and on the coast. There is the potential for its wider distribution and impacts if African Thistle invades better soils away from the coast (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nAgriculture: Large colonies, consisting of matted stems, limit pasture growth and available grazing area, reducing the productivity and economic returns of pasture areas. It is n0t grazed by stock and can invade sandy pastures (DPIRD 2020).\n\nNative ecosystems: African Thistle can impact on biodiversity by competing with native species in natural areas, including coastal foreshores, dune areas, scrub and shrub-land, tussock grassland and woodland (Carr et al. 1992; Keighery & Longman 2004; Thompson Berrill Landscape Design Pty Ltd 2006; Western Australian Herbarium 2007). It has also been recorded growing in reasonably intact native vegetation in south-western Western Australia (e.g. in coastal areas near Augusta) (DEEDI 2020).\n\nUrban areas: Dense patches can also impact on recreational areas and activities by preventing access to beaches and facilities (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Depending on where plant is found, may impede access for humans. The spines are disconcerting to even well-seasoned bare feet and can be very disturbing if they penetrate blankets’ (Meadley 1956).",

A plan should include an inventory of African Thistle infestations in the area designated for control action, well-defined objectives, feasible control actions, follow-up actions, a realistic timeline and a budget, as a minimum.\n\nChemical control: Larger colonies can be chemically sprayed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand remove isolated or small populations plants through spring and early summer.\n\nCultivation: Cultivation of the soils will break up rhizome and could spread the plant and should be avoided unless follow-up cultivation can occur until the  energy in the rhizomes is exhausted,  as African Thistle spreads via creeping underground stems and can form large colonies.\n\nFire: Single plants should be dug out and burned before flowering, making sure as much of the rhizome system is removed as possible.",

On the mainland, sites where it has naturalised have an average annual rainfall of approximately 1000–1400 mm per year, at an altitude between 300 and 1000 m. Sites of naturalisation in Tasmania may be as low as 150 m above sea level and the rainfall may be as much as 2000 mm per year. Soils in these areas are typically fertile mountain loams or clay loams (Tasmanian Herbarium 2007; National Herbarium of Victoria 2007; Bureau of Meteorology).",

    "impact": "Little is documented on the species behaviour and impacts in Australia. It forms locally dense thickets in wet forest in New Zealand (Allen 1991).\n\nNative and urban ecosystems: In Victoria, at least, the species appears to have now established well away from any garden source, particularly along tracks and roadsides, in high-quality, tall open forest (Walsh 2008 pers. comm.) and may sometimes establish on ground disturbed by Lyrebirds and Wombats (Blood 2001).\n\nAgriculture: Species of Berberis are obligate hosts for a stage of the life cycle of species of Puccinia, a rust that can have devastating effects on cereal crops. For this reason, Berberis species are prohibited for import into Australia (Spencer 1997).",
    "controlMethods": "Chemical control: There are no control methods specific to Darwin's Barberry found for Australia, but techniques common to woody weeds (e.g., 'drill and fill', injecting a suitable herbicide into drill holes at the base of the plant) are probably the most appropriate (Muyt 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: In New Zealand control methods include hand-pulling of young plants and cutting stems prior to painting with herbicide (Christchurch City Council 2008). Research into the biology of the plant in New Zealand provides useful information for non-chemical control of the species: 'the first priority for control should be to remove the seed source (adult plants). Follow-up seedling control need only continue for 1–2 years, since the seed bank is short-lived. When the seed source cannot be completely removed and re-invasion is likely, seedling control can be concentrated on high light environments, because first-year seedlings occurring in the shade will largely die out naturally. Plants growing in high light can produce fruit within two years, so new seedlings should be removed within this time frame wherever possible' (McAlpine & Lesson 2007).",

Cultivated species include B. atrocarpa, B. microphylla, B. coxii, B. × stenophylla and B. thunbergii. The last of these is distinguished by its deciduous, non-spiny leaves, and the other species differ from Darwin's Barberry in having longer leaves (Spencer 1997).",

    "habitat": "Kochia is native to arid and desert regions of Eurasia (Mosyakin 2003). It is an annual weed of crops and pastures throughout the world, especially in regions with warm climates (Dodd 2004). Kochia grows well in conditions similar to those required by cereal crops in southern Australia; that is, climates with hot, sunny summers (CRC 2003). It is extremely drought tolerant and, in the United States, grows in areas that receive as little as 150 mm of rainfall per annum (Esser 1995; CRC 2003). It invades disturbed sites, crops, pastures, flood plains, riparian habitats and rangelands (Esser 1995; CRC 2003). It tolerates saline soils and can flourish even when irrigated with water that is one-third the salinity of seawater (CRC 2003). It prefers open unshaded areas (Esser 1995). Much of central and southern Australia is climatically suitable for Kochia (CRC 2003). The ability of Kochia to prosper on degraded and saline sites has lead to it being used as a revegetation and fodder species in Australia (CRC 2003) and North America (Esser 1995).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Kochia (Bassia scoparia) is on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 non-native plants that threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage. Kochia is well adapted to out-compete crop, pasture and native plants and it also impacts human health causing allergies. Kochia spreads rapidly producing chemicals from its roots that inhibit the growth of nearby plants (allelopathic), i.e. it gives itself a competitive advantage by producing chemicals that reduce the growth rate and germination of other nearby desirable plant species (CRC 2003; Esser 1995). Its tumbleweed behaviour and annual lifecycle allows it to spread seed over long distances in short times. Its fast growth rate results in a large plant that competes for both light and nutrients\n\nAgriculture: It competes with pastures reducing productivity, contaminates and reduces crop production (including cereal crops) and hosts crop disease (DPI NSW 2019). Kochia can infest many different crops as well as pastures, fire-breaks, fence-lines, roadsides and railway lines. (DPIRD WA 2020). Livestock readily graze Kochia, and it is considered a good forage plant in arid and semi-arid parts of the United States of America. However, it is toxic if overgrazed (Esser 1995). High levels of oxalate, nitrate and alkaloids are contained in the plant, and accumulations of these compounds can lead to toxicity (CRC 2003; Department of Agriculture and Food 2007). Kochia, eaten in large quantities has caused deaths in cattle, sheep and horses. The shoots contain chemicals (oxalates, nitrates and alkaloids) that can poison animals. Poisoning symptoms can include, dehydration, weight loss, weak muscles, runny eyes, sensitivity to sunlight (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nNative ecosystems: Can alters fire regimes by increasing fuel loads in  saline areas. Not widely recorded as a weed of native areas, However, it is able to grow and colonise saline areas and has the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems (CRC 2003). Kochia (Bassia scoparia) is on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 invasive plants that have the potential to threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage in Australia. It was included on this list because of its rapid spread from deliberate plantings in Western Australia, and because of its history of invasiveness overseas (e.g. it is one of the fastest spreading of all invasive plants in the USA). It can also alter fire regimes in natural ecosystems and form dense infestations that reduce the abundance of native plants.",
    "controlMethods": "A variety of control methods have been successfully used against Kochia (Bassia scoparia) in Australia. Methods used in the eradication of Kochia from Western Australia include the application of herbicide, grazing, burning of large seeding plants to destroy formed seed, and mechanical removal (Dodd 2004). These methods proved to be very successful with most infestations being eradicated within 2 years of starting the control (Dodd 2004). In some instances in North America, Kochia has become resistant to sulfonurea and triazine herbicides (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control:  Herbicides were delivered from the ground and aerially for larger infestations (CRC 2003). See DPIRD (2020) & DPI NSW (2019) for list of chemical controls and the rates.  Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control:  High densities of sheep were used to provide extreme grazing pressure that caused defoliation of large plants and destruction of seedlings. Grubbing, the physical removal of plants from the ground, was also conducted where appropriate. Flaming, where plants are burnt by a flame thrower or similar, was used on mature, seeding plants to kill the seeds (CRC 2003). in Tasmania in 1995,1997 and 1998, when seeds were discovered as a contaminant of imported carrot seed, hand pulling was used to remove all plants, which numbered less than 50 in each of the infestations. Although some plants set seed at some sites, no seedlings were found, possibly because of the herbicides used to control other weeds (CRC 2003).\n\nDo not try to control Kochia without expert assistance. Control effort that is poorly performed or not followed up can actually help spread the weed and worsen the problem (CRC 2003). For a summary of eradicating Kochia in Western Australia, see; Dodd (2004); Dodd and Randall ( 2002).",

Cattle do not eat Barleria, and their movements, as well as those of other animals, may be impeded where it occurs around waterways. It can also provide refuges for feral animals.\n\nNative ecosystems: Barleria is found in natural ecosystems, such as open woodland or along watercourses, in the Northern Territory, where it can be very persistent and difficult to remove. While it is not particularly active in the dry season it becomes extremely vigorous with the onset of the wet.\n\nHuman impacts: Clearly it is not desirable in areas of human recreation and may reduce the capacity for indigenous people to exploit natural resources in infested areas (CRC 2003). The spines of Barleria stems can also cause injury (Weeds of Australia, 2016).",

    "habitat": "The preferred environment of Groundsel Bush appears to be margins of freshwater or saltwater swamps, estuaries or canals, but it is also able to colonise overgrazed pastures and other degraded land. It is capable of tolerating a wide range of soil salinity and pH (alkalinity or acidity) (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: In agricultural situations, Groundsel Bush successfully competes with pasture species and without early eradication will rapidly reduce productivity and become difficult to control. In native vegetation it establishes in freshwater and estuarine littoral shrublands (e.g. those dominated by Melaleuca, Avicennia marina, Casuarina glauca and adjacent eucalypt-dominated and/or rainforest communities) (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; National Herbarium of Victoria 2007).\n\nIt is reported to kill cattle, sheep and chickens if consumed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems: Groundsel Bus is of most concern in sub-tropical melaleuca wetlands, where it can form a dense understorey that suppresses the growth of native sedges and interferes with the natural ecosystem. It can also become abundant in native vegetation along watercourses and in coastal woodlands and forests. Conservation areas are also under threat from invasion by this species, and it has invaded several reserves in Queensland (e.g. Noosa National Park, Maroochy River Conservation Park and Pimpama River Conservation Area) and New South Wales (e.g. Ballina Nature Reserve, Wooyung Nature Reserve and Cullendulla National Park) (Biosecurity Queensland 2016).\n\nHuman: The wind dispersed seed can be a nuisance in urban areas where it sticks to insect screens and germinates in home gardens. Urban problems include potential allergies caused by air-borne pollen and the air-borne seed 'fluff' (pappus) (Land Protection 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Recommended control methods involve hand removal of small plants; maintaining healthy pasture so that establishment niches are unavailable; burning or cutting plants and either painting stumps or spraying regrowth with a range of registered herbicides. Plants regenerate from rootstocks, so burning or cutting plants alone is usually insufficient to achieve control (Land Protection 2007).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Groundsel Bush has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. A range of insect biological control agents have been tried and six of these have established and offer some control: Stem Borer (Megacyllene mellyi), Plume Moth (Oidaematophorus balanotes), Gall Fly (Rhopalomyia californica), Groundsel Bush Leaf Beetle (Trirhabda baccharidis), Leaf Skeletoniser (Aristotelia ivae) and a Leaf Miner (Buccalatrix iveila).

It competes effectively for soil nutrients, reducing productivity and increasing management costs. It could also become and agricultural weed in Australia. It could potentially affect crops such as soybeans, vegetables, cut flowers and oil-tea tree (CRC 2003).\n\nNative ecosystems: Chinese violet can smother all vegetation in the herbaceous layer (Pier 2006) reducing the availability of habitat for native plants and animals, hence reducing biodiversity (CRC 2003).",

Small infestations can be easily eradicated if they are detected early but an ongoing commitment is needed to ensure new infestations do not establish. Management of the soil seedbank is particularly important and follow up over a number of years is the key to managing infestations (CRC 2003).\n\nChemical control: Some herbicides are available to treat A. gangetica [as A. gangetica subsp. micrantha] infestations. As maintaining groundcover and competitive desirable species is important, always get advice before spraying. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand weeding is a suitable approach for small infestations. Extreme care must be taken to ensure correct disposal of plant material. Much of the spread of A. gangetica [as A. gangetica ssp. micrantha] has been attributed to the incorrect disposal of plant parts which can contain seeds and broken stems which readily establish and form new plants, causing the infestation to spread. The best disposal methods which will kill seeds cheaply and easily are still being investigated (CRC 2003).\n\nSlashing prior to seed set may help control A. gangetica [as A. gangetica ssp. micrantha]. However, equipment must be carefully cleaned to prevent further spread. Cultivation should also be avoided (CRC 2003).\n\nFire and biological control are not currently part of the control strategy for A. gangetica. However, revegetation may be helpful as competition from other vegetation can help suppress seedling germination. Planting alternative indigenous groundcovers and avoiding bare ground wherever possible can help prevent A. gangetica [as A. gangetica ssp. micrantha] taking hold (CRC 2003).\n\nAny new outbreaks should be reported immediately to your state or territory weed management agency or local council.

Based on his work most Australian material would agree more closely with A. gangetica subsp. gangetica in having flowers more than 25 mm long. However material collected in New South Wales represents the more aggressive form of this species, subsp. micrantha, which has a flower length of less than 25 mm, although flower size is not always reliable in Australian material (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",

    "habitat": "Onion Weed occurs on roadsides, railway lines, neglected areas and poorer pastures, in semi-arid areas and sandy coastal environments. It establishes most readily in disturbed situations where there is little competition and shows a distinct preference for sandy alkaline soils of low fertility and in areas with an annual rainfall of 250-500 mm, usually with a winter dominance (DAFWA 2007; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Onion Weed will establish readily in areas disturbed by cultivation such as roadside grading and cable laying trenches (DAFWA 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Onion Weed (Asphodelus fistulosus) establishes in disturbed situations, favouring alkaline sandy soils. It is a weed of overgrazed pastures and rangelands, degraded and open native vegetation and coastal areas, along roadsides and tracks and some other native habitats. For example, it has been observed to invade relatively undisturbed open woodland communities as well as dry coastal vegetation, mallee shrubland, lowland grasslands, grassy woodlands and rocky outcrop vegetation. (Queensland Government 2016), and is now widespread and common from coast to arid inland (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nAgriculture: A weed of cereal crops and a major threat to arid rangelands. Because of its prolific seed production and tolerance of dry conditions, Onion Weed invades degraded pastures, competing strongly with other species. It is unpalatable to livestock, so the carrying capacity of grazing land is significantly reduced (Storrie 2003). Overcropping or overgrazing allows Onion Weed to dominate by lowering fertility and degrading natural pastures. Low soil nitrogen is a critical factor that prevent other plants growing on areas dominated by onion weed. It is a very conspicuous pioneer plant on bare sandy soils and rapidly occupies paddocks where the pasture has become sparse, leading to an assumption that it was a cause of the pasture's decline. On abandoned farmland in the Victorian mallee region, it is one of the species that dominates at first but declines as the native vegetation regenerates and almost disappears after about 5 years. It does not compete effectively with vigorous pasture, and cannot dominate where sustainable farming systems are practiced (Government of South Australia 2015).\n\nOnion Weed is of value to the honey industry, producing plentiful pollen which is important when establishing hives (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: It will also invade relatively undisturbed woodland (Storrie 2003), but thrives in degraded and open native vegetation on stony or sandy calcareous soils. Onion Weed does not invade undisturbed dry mallee vegetation due to the competition from the root systems of established trees and shrubs, but does invaded some open dry inland native vegetation that have been degraded by decades over grazing, or on the edge of intact healthy vegetation  Invades roadside vegetation, especially in dry or some coastal areas.\n\nUrban areas: Common along roadsides, abandoned land, and open degraded dry areas, especially on stony or sandy calcareous soils. It is thought to cause dermatitis in some people (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "Onion Weed (Asphodelus fistulosus) may be controlled manually or with the use of herbicides.  Prevention of spread, and targeting new infestations, is the best management approach with this species (Storrie 2003).  Onion Weed does not (or rarely) invade well managed pastures or cropping areas.\n\nChemical control: Onion Weed may be controlled with the use of herbicides. Several herbicides are registered for the control of Onion Weed. Broad scale use of the herbicides is expensive and research is continuing to test for products that will either control the plant or inhibit seed production to restrict the spread (DAFWA 2007). For further information please see: DPI NSW (2019); Western Australian Herbarium (1998–).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for further chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Onion Weed may be controlled manually by hand-pulling or cultivation.\n\nHand pulling: Hand pulling is effective and can be used for outliers and small infestations.  Large plants have the ability to continue to set seed after they have been removed from the soil. Therefore, hand-pulled plants that are flowering need to be removed and bagged to prevent seeding (Storrie 2003).\nMechanical control: In cropping areas, small plants can be killed by cultivation, although large plants that are dislodged can re-root and recommence growing. Large plants also cause significant blockages in pronged implements such as scarifiers and cultivators.\nCompetition and management:  Does not establish in well managed pastures or well managed cropping land. Onion weed is rarely an economic problem for primary production and sustainable land use in areas where it is established. The actual problems of these lands are low fertility and overgrazing (Government of South Australia 2015).",

    "similarSpecies": "In Western Australia and South Australia, Onion Weed (Asphodelus fistulosus) is often confused with the closely related Strapweed or Dune Onion Weed (Trachyandra divaricata) (DAFWA 2007; Rippey & Rowland 2004), also an introduced weed. Onion Weed can be distinguished from this species as its leaves are hollow and upright, rather than flat and sprawling as in Dune Onion Weed, and having a flower head that is narrow and compact, rather than much-branched and wide-spreading as in Dune Onion Weed (Rippey & Rowland 2004).\n\nA number of different, unrelated species have the common name 'Onion Weed'. These include Allium triquetrum and Nothoscordum borbonicum [as Nothoscordum gracile], which are mostly weeds of gardens and cultivation, and Romulea rosea, which is a weed of lawns, pastures and woodlands.\n\nAsphodelus fistulosus is the only one of these with cylindrical hollow stems and the only one of these that doesn't grow from bulbs or corms. Of these four species, Allium triquetrum is the only one that smells of onion or garlic when the leaves are crushed (CRC for Australian Weed Management 2003). Individual weed profiles for other species known as 'Onion Weed' are also available on this web site.",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Bridal Veil (Asparagus declinatus) is a Weed of National Significance (WONS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts (CRC 2003). it is an invasive soft herb or vine that forms dense impenetrable thickets  excluding desirable species.\n\nAgriculture: Bridal Veil (Asparagus declinatus)  is not known or reported as a problematic agricultural weed.\n\nNative ecosystems:  Bridal Veil (Asparagus declinatus) is a highly invasive environmental weed and unlike most environmental weeds can establish in undisturbed native vegetation. The climbing stems form a dense canopy which smothers other vegetation, Bridal Veil is an invasive and aggressive environmental weed that produces thick tuberous root masses and dense foliage that smothers and out-competes the surrounding native vegetation. It forms a dense, underground, tuberous root mass that prevents native plant recruitment and regeneration (Lawrie 2006), reducing available soil moisture and nutrients, impacting on native animals. The underground well developed rhizomes and numerous tubers allow the plant to tolerate dry periods. It colonises and dominates both the shrub and herb levels, leading to displacement of native vegetation in native systems including rocky outcrops, various woodlands, and coastal habitats.\n\nUrban areas: Bridal Veil (Asparagus declinatus) grows on urban fringes and edges, on abandoned or degraded land, that further spread beyond in to native vegetation.",
    "controlMethods": "Control of Bridal Veil (Asparagus declinatus) is possible by chemical and mechanical means. Other less common control methods include grazing and fire. Grazing by cattle and sheep can successfully keep Bridal Veil at low levels and prevent fruit production. Biological control options are not available for Bridal Veil.\n\nChemical control: Applying herbicide is the most common method of controlling Bridal Veil. Herbicide is most effective when sprayed during the winter to early spring flowering period when plants are actively growing. However, leaves of Bridal Veil are fine and waxy which can make herbicide application difficult, as the chemicals do not adhere to the leaves very well. Trials by the Kangaroo Island Asparagus Weeds Committee have shown that emulsifiable vegetable oil mixed with the herbicide will help the chemicals to stick (Lawrie 2006).\n\nHowever, because Bridal Veil often grows in areas of native vegetation, it is particularly important to avoid contact with desirable plants or soil near tree root zones. Isolated plants can be treated with a recommended herbicide applied by spot spraying. As infestations become larger, a strategically staged approach for removal is advisable to ensure that treated areas are not re-infested (CRC 2003). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical removal of Bridal Veil involves carefully excavating around and under the tuberous root mass and then levering it out with hand tools. This control method is only effective if all of the tuberous root mass, including the rhizomes, are dug up and removed from the site (Lawrie 2006). This may be possible for new, small infestations or as a follow-up after several years of herbicide control of a larger infestation. Slashing the stems and leaves may prevent fruit production and slowly deplete root reserves but it will not eradicate an infestation (CRC 2003). Small infestations can be controlled by hand pulling where practical.\n\nHand pulling can only be used for small plants and infestation. The rhizomes (main growing points at the top of the soil where the stem emerge) should be removed when hand pulling.  If the plant breaks leaving any or all the rhizome, plants will immediately regrow if conditions allow.\n\nMechanical control: However, for large dense infestations where little to no native plants remain mechanical removal of above ground parts parts may help.\n\nCompetition and management: Grazing can provide some control. Sheep will graze on the new shoots and are more likely to chew it down than cattle. However, Bridal Veil is not a preferred food source for sheep and cattle and so grazing should be considered as an opportunistic control method and not relied upon to eradicate an infestation (Lawrie 2006).\n\nDisposal: When removing material off-site, rhizomes can regrow and re-shoot if not killed. Any rhizomes that come in to contact with the ground, on or off site, will re-shoot. Material can be composted or solarised and the same methods should be used for the fruits containing seeds, as these can germinate and grow in to new plants. If the plant is being removed from gardens, dispose of it through local government kerbside collection or tip facilities. Fruiting shoot material should be bagged immediately to avoid it being dropped or dispersed by birds. Root material (which can survive being dried for long periods) and seeds should not be composted or mulched (CRC 2003).\n\nFire: Fire can also be useful in reducing above ground biomass of larger infestations. The effectiveness of fire as a control method is yet to be verified. Previous experiments using fire have had little impact on the underground tuber mat due to difficulties in maintaining fire intensity. In some high rainfall regions of South Australia, it has been observed that tubers grow in the leaf litter. A high intensity fire may ‘cook’ and ultimately destroy these tubers (Lawrie 2006).\n\nBiological control: At present there are no biological control agents for Bridal Veil in Australia (Lawrie 2006).\n\nFor further information see the Asparagus Weeds Best Practice Management Manual (available at https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/-/media/OEH/Corporate-Site/Documents/Animals-and-plants/Pests-and-weeds/asparagus-weeds-management-manual-130486.pdf ).",

Rare native plants are threatened with extinction by Bridal Creeper (CRC 2003), and a profusion of rhizomes and tubers below ground which suppresses other ground flora and It is able to tolerate dry periods due to its well developed rhizomes and numerous tubers (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Le Cussan 2006; Vivian-Smith & Grimshaw 2006).\n\nUrban areas: Grows on urban fringes and edges, on abandoned or degraded land, that further spread beyond in to native vegetation.",
    "controlMethods": "Control of Bridal Creeper (Asparagus asparagoides) is possible by chemical, mechanical means and biological control. However, when mature flowering plants and rhizomes (underground growing points) are removed seedling may germinate from the soil seed bank and follow-up is critical. Integrated control methods combining techniques, with long term follow-up is advised for success. Preventing spread to new areas by animals is difficult, so preventing seed set is important and the best form of control. When controlling Bridal Creeper (Asparagus asparagoides) the underground rhizome, need to be removed or comprehensively killed as re-growth can occur. Large plants with extensive root systems and underground rhizomes can and will survive herbicide application as some rhizomes are not  killed and follow-up may be required.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides have been the most effective method of control. However, because Bridal Creeper often grows in areas of native vegetation, it is particularly important to avoid contact with desirable plants or soil near tree root zones. Isolated plants can be treated with a recommended herbicide applied by spot spraying. As infestations become larger, a strategically staged approach for removal is advisable to ensure that treated areas are not re-infested (CRC 2003). In citrus and avocado orchards it is difficult to spray Bridal Creeper entwined in the leaves of trees. Pruning lower limbs to provide access underneath trees, a practice known as ‘skirting’, enables spot spraying with a recommended herbicide. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Physical removal is not effective unless all the rhizomes are dug up and destroyed. This may be possible for new, small infestations or as a follow-up after several years of herbicide control of a larger infestation. Slashing the stems and leaves may prevent fruit production and slowly deplete root reserves but it will not eradicate an infestation (CRC 2003). Small infestations can be controlled by hand pulling where practical.\n\nHand pulling can only be used for small plants and infestation. The rhizomes (main growing points at the top of the soil where the stem emerge) should be removed when hand pulling.  If the plant breaks leaving any or all the rhizome, plants will immediately regrow if conditions allow.\n\nMechanical control: However, for large dense infestations where little to no native plants remain, mechanical removal of above ground parts parts may help.\n\nCompetition and management: Grazing can provide some control of Bridal Creeper. Tamar Wallabies on Garden Island in Western Australia have successfully kept it at low levels there, and sheep grazing may be an option to control it under trees in remnant vegetation, woodlots and shelterbelts (CRC 2003).\n\nDisposal: When removing material off-site, rhizomes can regrow and re-shoot if not killed. Any rhizomes that come in to contact with the ground, on or off site, will re-shoot. Material can be composted or solarised and the same methods should be used for the fruits containing seeds, as these can germinate and grow in to new plants. If the plant is being removed from gardens, dispose of it through local government kerbside collection or tip facilities. Fruiting shoot material should be bagged immediately to avoid it being dropped or dispersed by birds. Root material (which can survive being dried for long periods) and seeds should not be composted or mulched (CRC 2003).\n\nFire: Fire can also be useful in reducing above ground biomass of larger infestations. In winter-rainfall areas, Bridal Creeper often emerges before the first autumn rains so herbicides may be applied before post-fire regeneration of native vegetation. As well as improving the effectiveness of herbicide application, fire may help to destroy Bridal Creeper seed and the dense tuber mat. However, use of fire requires permission from government authorities and its frequent use may endanger the survival of many native plant populations (CRC 2003).\n\nFires in late summer and early autumn can remove all under-storey vegetation and improve access for later spraying. If fire is used, regrowth should be treated carefully with herbicide to limit above-ground growth and further reduce the stored root reserves. Infestations should be monitored regularly and over several years because of the probability of regrowth from remnants of the root system. Regularly check for new incursions, carefully removing them or treating them with herbicide, as necessary. For new or small infestations hand digging of roots may be an appropriate follow-up technique (CRC 2003).\n\nBiological control: Effective treatment of Bridal Creeper with herbicides or manual removal is expensive and labour intensive. These control methods are not feasible in many areas because of the size and inaccessibility of infestations. Biological control is viewed as a preferred management option for Bridal Creeper infestations of this type (Wills 1999). There are three biological control agents that have been released in Australia. However, it will take many years for the biological control agents to reduce the density of Bridal Creeper due to the huge reserves stored underground in tubers (CRC 2003). An effective biological control agent on Bridal Creeper is the rust (Puccinia myrsiphyllii), that attacks leaves and stems that can have a major impact on the levels of reserves in the tubers, but the rust is not effective on the Wester Cape Form. There is also a leafhopper, a sap sucking insect that feeds on the photosynthetic cells causing them to turn white, and a leaf beetle that feeds exclusivly on the young expanding new tissues of leaves and shoot tips therefore reducing biomass and fruit production.\n\nFor further information see the Asparagus Weeds Best Practice Management Manual (available at https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/-/media/OEH/Corporate-Site/Documents/Animals-and-plants/Pests-and-weeds/asparagus-weeds-management-manual-130486.pdf ).",
    "origin": "Bridal Creeper is native to Cape province, Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal regions of South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, KwaZulu-Natal, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Northern Provinces, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe (POWO 2020). As well as being naturalised in Australia it is also naturalised in southern Europe, New Zealand, western United States and the islands of the north Atlantic ocean collectively known as Macaronesia (USDA 2007).",
    "growthForm": "Vine, Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "The native species Wombat Berry (Eustrephus latifolius) and Scrambling Lily (Geitonoplesium cymosum), have adult foliage with parallel venation similar to Bridal Creeper. Wombat Berry and Scrambling Lily both have true leaves rather than reduced leaves at the base of the leaf-like cladodes. Wombat Berry can be further distinguished by having a yellow to orange fleshy capsular fruit while both Bridal Creeper and Scrambling Lily have fleshy berries. Bridal Creeper has red fruit when ripe whereas Scrambling Lily has black fruit (Navie 2004; Connors 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nThe Western Cape form of Asparagus aspargoidies is very similar looking, and this is most likely another species that is unaffected by the leaf rust (Puccinia myrsipyllii).  The western cape form has sightly larger leaves and bigger tubers that or grouped like a bunch of grapes in the soil not forming cylindrical long chains of tuber like the common form of Bridal Creeper.\n\nFor information on distinguishing the two forms of Bridal Creeper, see the Asparagus Weeds Best Practice Management Manual (available at https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/-/media/OEH/Corporate-Site/Documents/Animals-and-plants/Pests-and-weeds/asparagus-weeds-management-manual-130486.pdf).",

Timing of application is important with some herbicides and follow up spraying will be needed to control newly emergent seedlings (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Breadon et al. 2006; Le Cussan 2006).

Crowning is a useful method for removing Asparagus aethiopicus and other crown-forming Asparagus species (with all underground points concentrated close to the soil surface where the stem emerge). This method of control involves removing the rhizomes (the growing points) and prevents the plant from regrowing. Other roots and swollen tubers can be left in the soil as these are not growing points and will not regrow. However, as some rhizomes may be missed, (left in the soil), continued monitoring should be carried out not only for re-growth but for seedling germination (Office for Environment and Heritage, 2013).

It occurs mainly in moist areas, growing along lakes, stream and river banks, swamp areas, roadsides and urban bushland, generally in subtropical and tropical regions. It occasionally occurs in wetter inland regions of Australia (Navie 2004; Linder 2005), in ephemeral sandy creeks in arid and semi-arid areas.",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agricultural: Mainly grows in riparian areas and can form dense infestations preventing animals movement and access to water ways in rangelands.  The stems and leaves contain alkaloids, tryptamines and other toxins that make them inedible to most herbivorous insects and also deter grazing animals (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Giant Reed can be aggressive as an invasive plant and can out-compete and displace native plant and animal species due to the formation of dense monocultures and extensive clonal root systems in riparian or damp areas, especially in ephemeral creeks in semi-arid to arid areas.  If Giant Reed becomes abundant, it can alter riparian areas from flood-defined to fire-defined natural communities (Bell 1997). The removal of native plant species can negatively impact on native fauna, particularly birds, which often require habitat and food resources provided by native plants. All evidence suggests that Giant Reed provides neither habitat nor food to native wildlife due to toxins in the pants deterring animals. Large dense infestations can block and change stream flow causing flooding due to their bulk and ability to trap sediment and floating debris. The dry stems and dry leaves are highly flammable, increasing fire risk and intensity in riparian vegetation. The dense stands of Giant Reed can resprout quickly after burning (Bell 1997). It can therefore quickly replace native vegetation after fires, and can present a fire hazard in native and urban areas (Dudley 1998, PIER 2007). Giant Reed also provided little shading over in-stream habitats, resulting in increased water temperatures that may impact on aquatic flora and fauna (Bell 1997; Dudley 1998). Giant Reed is also suspected of releasing toxins into the water which deter other plants and favor its own growth. Toxins in the plant itself make it unpalatable to native fauna (Bell 1997; Dudley 1998; CRC 2005).\n\nUrban areas: Can be found in urban areas and can escape, impact, and spread if grow along river banks, wetlands, roadsides and wastelands, It has been cultivated in parks and gardens, but most plants are remnant or weedy populations in cities and towns. Due to its height, it has been known, to interfere with and short-circuit power lines, causing fires (Armstrong & Breaden 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Smaller infestations can be removed manually, but it is labour intensive as all underground rhizomes must be removed to prevent regeneration; however, manual removal is more selective and may be necessary to prevent damage to nearby native plants (Starr et al. 2003). Hand pulling can be effective on plants of less than 2 m in height, while larger plants can be removed using hand tools, especially in combination with cutting off stems near their base (Dudley 1998). Stems and roots should be removed and preferably burned on site to prevent further dispersal through disposal of the waste offsite. However, any rhizomes (underground stems) left in the ground will re-grow\n\nMechanical control: Larger monotypic stands can be mechanically removed by bulldozing or by tractor. This can be effective before the manual removal of underground rhizomes or chemical control (Starr et al. 2003; Armstrong & Breaden 2007).\n\nFire: Burning can be effective for the removal of above-ground vegetation, but is not recommended as it does not kill the rhizomes, and may favour the weed over native species during regeneration (Starr et al. 2003).\n\nChemical control: The most effective treatment of Giant Reed is to apply herbicides to the leaves immediately post flowering and before the plants become dormant in cooler months (i.e. when the plant is actively transporting nutrients to the roots), so the herbicide is effectively transported to the root mass (Bell 1997). Chemical control is also effectively applied when the above-ground vegetation has been cut. Stems must be treated immediately after cutting to ensure uptake of the herbicide (Bell 1997). Frequent follow-up applications are recommended over the following six months (Dudley 1998).\n\nA combination of these control methods is also effective, where stems are cut to the ground and allowed to regrow for approximately six weeks, when herbicides are then applied. This will reduce the amount of chemical needed and allows it to be more evenly applied (Bell 1997). It should be noted, however, that the use of herbicides can be problematic near waterways (CRC 2005).\n\nPlease see; Brisbane City Council 2021; DPI NSW (2019); Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018); the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: It is suspected that Dutchman's Pipe is poisonous to cattle, horses and domestic fowl (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977).\n\nNative ecosystems: Rapid growth and prolific seeding gives Dutchman's Pipe the potential to significantly impact on biodiversity in areas of native vegetation. It can invade areas of remnant bushland where it forms dense masses which out compete native species, thereby degrading the structure of the ecosystem and reducing biodiversity (McClymont 1998).\n\nNative fauna: The non-native Aristolochia species are very similar to the native Aristolochiaceae which are the natural food plants for the larvae of a number of Australian Birdwing Butterflies (Ornithoptera richmondia Richmond Birdwing and Ornithoptera euphorion Cairns Birdwing). However the non-native Aristolochia species are a deadly alternative as they are toxic to the larvae when they feed. The survival of the Richmond Birdwing Butterfly is threatened by the spread of these plants within its distributional range (Sands & New 2002; Land Protection 2007).",
    "controlMethods": "In Queensland, Aristolochia (Aristolochia species other than native species) are declared plants under the Land Protection (Pest and Stock Route Management) Act 2002, which prohibits the supply or sale of these plants and may require their removal from environmentally significant areas within the state (Jordan 2007).\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Small plants can be controlled by removing above ground parts and digging up the root base, ensuring crowns (where stem and roots join) and roots are removed. However, care needs to be taken as the plants are poisonous and all parts of the plant should not be handled without gloves (McClymont 1998; Save Our Waterways Now 2008). Mechanical control: Larger vines that extend up into the canopy can be difficult to dig out without causing a lot of disturbance to adjacent native seedlings. An alternative method is to cut through vine stems at chest height and leave them to die in the canopy. This is done preferably before the vine has set seed. Any fruit within reach should be collected and removed from the site. The basal section of stem is cut and scraped back towards the main root and then an appropriate herbicide is applied to the scraped stem section. This increases the surface area of exposed plant vascular tissue available for absorption of the applied herbicide (McClymont 1998).\n\nChemical control: Foliar spraying is usually ineffective against large vines because leaves are covered by a waxy cuticle that prevents herbicide penetration. However, young plants and regrowth shoots are more susceptible to herbicide application (McClymont 1998).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "impact": "Mexican Poppy was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Mexican Poppy was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. Under suitable conditions, Mexican Poppy forms large and dense populations that can impede the movement of stock and wildlife and displace native vegetation (Weber 2003). Seedlings are poor competitors (Weber 2003).\n\nAgriculture: Widely distributed in the pastoral/rangeland areas, mainly along river systems, moist flats and sand dunes in arid areas. Mexican Poppy is also present in some agricultural areas, but does not compete well with crops or in managed pastures (DPIRD WA 2020). It grows well in sugarcane and cereal crops but is generally not regarded as an aggressive crop weed in Australia (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It establishes readily on wasteland and overgrazed pastures (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The prickly fruits can become entangled in wool, reducing its value considerably (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Mexican Poppy is a host for Verticillium and the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (Bromilow 2001). Mexican poppy is poisonous to stock and humans, but is rarely eaten by stock. Reported cases of poisoning are rare as livestock tend to avoid it in the field due to its unpalatable bitter yellow sap. Contamination of stock feed with seeds of Mexican poppy may result in poisoning (DPI NSW 2019; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Poisonings may occur as a result of hay and chaff containing traces of the plant (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nHuman impacts: It is suspected of being toxic to animals and humans due to the presence of alkaloids in all parts of the plant.  (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Poisonings in humans have occurred by the consumption of oils contaminated with the plant (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). For further information on the toxicity of Mexican Poppy see Everist (1974) and Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001). If poisoning occurs and:\n\nthe patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nthe patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",
    "controlMethods": "Prevention: As is the case with many annual weeds, control should be aimed at the prevention of seed formation (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Weber 2003).\n\nNon-chemical control: Successful control may be achieved by hand-pulling, grubbing or cutting plants before any fruits ripen (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Weber 2003). Good pasture management is effective in reducing the impact and preventing invasion of Mexican Poppy. Seedlings do not compete well with perennial crop and pasture species, nor does it compete well with established pasture (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).

This species is known to be naturalised only in north-eastern New South Wales (Ownbey 2007). It has flowers that are generally larger than those of the Mexican Poppy and a less spiny capsule (Ownbey 2007).

Mexican Poppy is a host for the Verticillium Wilt Fungus and the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (Bromilow 2001).",
    "controlMethods": "As is the case with many annual weeds, control of Mexican Poppy should be aimed at the prevention of seed formation. Successful control of Mexican Poppy may be achieved by hand-pulling, grubbing or cutting plants before any fruits ripen. Seedlings can be controlled effectively with herbicide or by mowing. Good pasture management is effective in reducing the impact and preventing invasion of Mexican Poppy. Seedlings do not compete well with perennial crop and pasture species, nor does they compete well with established pasture (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au/",

    "similarSpecies": "The name Mexican Poppy is often also applied to another species of Argemone (Argemone ochroleuca). Argemone mexicana differs from A. ochroleuca by its bright yellow flowers and globular flower buds, as opposed to the pale yellow flowers and egg-shaped buds of A. ochroleuca. Argemone mexicana has a more tropical distribution in Australia (Auld & Medd 1987).\n\nAnother similar species that is also naturalised in Australia is the American Poppy (Argemone subfusiformis subsp. subfusiformis). This species is known to be naturalised only in north-eastern New South Wales. It has flowers that are generally larger than those of the Mexican Poppy and a less spiny capsule. When not flowering Mexican Poppy could be mistaken for a Thistle due to the presence of prickles on the stems and leaves (Ownbey 2007).",

Such a plan should be based on integrated weed management principles and include an inventory of Stinking Mayweed infestations in the area to which the plan relates, well-defined objectives, practicable control actions, follow-up actions, a realistic timeline and a budget, as a minimum.\n\nChemical control: There are various herbicides available for effective chemical treatments, see  DPIPWE Tasmania (2019); Parsons & Cuthbertson( 2001); and Tamar Valley Weed Strategy (2015). Control is often difficult because there are a range of plants at different growth stages. Spot spray for smaller patches and boom spray for larger areas. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for further chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Individual plants and small infestations can be hoed or grubbed out using hand tools, ideally while at the seedling stage.\n\nMechanical control: Larger patches can be cultivated, with follow up action as required, to kill seedlings emerging from later germinations and the area sowed to pasture as soon as possible.\nCompetition and management: A cost-effective means of control is to sow and carefully manage a vigorous perennial pasture suited to the district, avoiding overgrazing.  Individual plants appearing in crops or pasture can be hoed or spot-sprayed.",

Its sheer weight is capable of breaking branches off trees, thereby reducing them to poles, potentially causing collapse of the rainforest canopy (ISSG 2006). It restricts light and thereby prevents germination of desirable native species (Harley undated).\n\nUrban areas: Madeira Vine is (or has) been used as a cultivated garden plant, and if not managed, its aggressive vegetative growth can smothering or damage other plants and structures, especially fence lines or sheds etc. It can often escape the garden and spread beyond property boundaries causing further damage.",
    "controlMethods": "Madeira Vine is difficult to control with physical and chemical methods. Single chemical and /or physical control activities generally cause disturbance that results in vigorous regrowth and can worsen infestation levels, unless dedicated follow-up occurs.\n\nChemical control: Madeira Vine is hard to kill with chemicals due to its numerous tubers, succulent waxy leaves, and numerous roots. It has been recommended by some authors that all aerial bulbils are physically removed, and follow-up foliar spray is used on plants and bulbils as soon as green sprouts have two or four leaves on each sprout. Timing of follow-up spraying is important because if left too long, new underground tubers will form, prolonging control efforts. Some authors suggest that scraping stems at staggered intervals then applying a herbicide is the only recommended control method. Aerial stems should be cut at both ends and dipped in a herbicide (Invasive Species Specialist Group 2006). DPI NSW (2019) website list some herbicide options.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control of Madeira Vine is very difficult. All parts of the vine must be removed, including underground tubers (rhizomes), aerial tubers and vines climbing up trees to prevent them from resprouting. Smaller Madeira Vine plants can be grubbed out ensuring that all of the bulbils are removed. Larger infestations can be controlled by cutting back top growth and spraying the remaining 2 metres of stems (Invasive Species Specialist Group 2006). Carefully hand pulling and hanging up the root system away from the soil where the tubers and rhizomes cannot re-root is effective as it eventually causes death to the root system. Tubers / rhizomes can be killed by freezing, treating with foliar herbicides, or bagged and left in the sun (Land Protection 2006).  As mentioned above in the chemical treatment section, the physical removal of any surviving bulbils that have fallen on the ground after chemical or any other control methods is required to prevent the establishment of new plants. It is important to not plant or spread plants to new areas. bulbils, rhizomes and other fleshy parts of the plant could be double bagged and thrown away in the trash or piled in one location on site. Precaution could be taken to not spread green waste to uninfected areas (ISSG 2006).\n\nBiological control: DPI NSW (2019) state that the leaf feeding beetle, Plectonycha correntina has recently been approved for release in Australia. Both the adult and larval stages feed on the leaves reducing the plant’s photosynthetic ability and depleting the energy stores in the bulbils and tubers. Releases have occurred in New South Wales and Queensland—and at many of these sites the beetle has established and significant leaf feeding damage has been observed. The beetles lay small yellow eggs in groups of 8-15 on the undersides of leaves. After 5 days, larvae emerge and start feeding, covering themselves with a sticky, black, gelatine-like substance. After 14 days, they begin to feed alone, leaving their slimy covering behind, and emerging as small white, then butter-yellow grubs (3-4 mm long) with black heads. They then burrow into the topsoil to pupate for another 20 days, and then emerge as adult beetles, able to reproduce 7 days later. Each female can lay an average of 550 eggs. Beetles should only be used at sites that will not be subject to herbicide treatment or physical removal, and only in flood- and frost-free areas.\n\nIn Ku-ring-gai National Park, near Sydney, New South Wales, efforts have been made to annually apply herbicide by the stem-scrape method to kill vines in situ and to kill existing aerial tubers and prevent the development of more. Madeira Vine tubers were picked from the soil once native seedlings began to regenerate and removed to landfill. Regrowth was spot sprayed with herbicide where there were no native seedlings. Although floods bring more tubers from upstream sources into the reserve, this strategy has almost eliminated the production of tubers within the reserve and thus protects the regenerating areas and bushland downstream in Garigal National Park from this threat (Pallin 2000).",
    "origin": "Madeira Vine is a native of tropical south America (PIER 2007).",

    "similarSpecies": "Madeira Vine is a very distinct species and is rarely confused with other species. Japanese Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) has a similar habit and grows in similar environments; however it has oppositely arranged leaves (leaves in pairs at the same stem joint (node)) and larger flowers that are borne in small clusters (Navie 2004).\n\nSome weedy vines are superficially similar to Madeira Vine because of their fleshy leaves. These are:\n\nCape Ivy (Delairea odorata), and the climbing groundsels (Senecio angulatus and Senecio tamoides).\n\nA native vine, Climbing Lignum (Meuhlenbeckia adpressa) has slightly fleshy leaves which may also have leaves with a heart-shaped (cordate) base like Anredera.\n\nSome native vines have glossy, but not fleshy, heart-shaped leaves, for example, Snake Vine (Stephania japonica), Pearl Vine (Sarcopetalum harveyanum), Round-leaf Vine (Legnephora moorei ) and Giant Pepper Vine (Piper hederaceum). Giant Pepper Vine clings to tree trunks with small suckers of aerial roots, unlike Madeira Vine which twines (Miles undated).",

It generally grows in freshwater and brackish swamps (e.g., in mangrove communities), in estuaries, along creeks and rivers, in rainforests and on rainforest margins, in coastal environs and along roadsides (Navie 2007). Some of the disturbed and undisturbed coastal ecosystems that Pond Apple invades include paperbark and pandanus wetlands, sedgelands and high tide zones on beaches. It can withstand extensive flooding and trees can spend weeks at a time with their roots under water (CRC 2003).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Pond Apple is a Weed of National Significance (WONS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nOver time, the dense thickets it forms can gradually replace everything else in the canopy and create an undesirable new habitat. Unlike many weeds, it can invade and transform undisturbed natural habitats. Its ability to grow in flooded areas and to tolerate salt water has enabled it to spread through much of northern Queensland’s wet tropics area. It now infests more than 2000 ha of the Wet Tropics Bioregion, and threatens Melaleuca wetlands and native mangrove communities (CRC 2003). Pond Apple is also a pioneering plant and will opportunistically invade areas after disturbances such as cyclones and floods (Land Protection 2006).\n\nWhile Pond Apple is mainly considered an environmental weed, its commercial impacts are also increasing as it spreads. It may also have impacts on the sugarcane and cattle industries in the future (CRC 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "Pond Apple usually grows in sensitive areas so control methods should be chosen that do not have an adverse impact on non-target plants or on the surrounding environment.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides recommended to control Pond Apple are available at present through permit for ‘minor off-label use’. Stem injection and cut stump are the preferred method for treating Pond Apple in aquatic habitats because it minimises herbicidal runoff and impacts on non-target plants and animals. In still, dry conditions, herbicide can also be applied by basal bark spraying and foliar spraying of seedlings (CRC 2003).\n\nNon-chemical control: Pond Apple can also be controlled mechanically by hand pulling, chain pulling and dozer pushing. Chain pulling and dozer pushing are only suitable on flat country in areas free of sensitive vegetation, where machines can manoeuvre easily (Land Protection 2006). Such sites must be monitored for new seedlings and should be revegetated with native plants (CRC 2003). Pond Apple is also very susceptible to fire; however, sufficient fuel is not often available in dense infestations of this species (Land Protection 2006).\n\nBiological control: This is currently not an option, mainly because other closely-related species are grown commercially in Australia (CRC 2003).\n\nCheck with your local council or state/territory government agency about its requirements for Pond Apple control. Also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nFor further information on control methods see the Pond Apple manual (available at https://www.weeds.org.au/WoNS/pondapple/ )",

These species can be distinguished from Pond Apple by their fruit. Pond Apple fruits have relatively smooth shiny surfaces, while the fruits of these other species are either covered in short projections, or have rough or knobby surfaces (Navie 2007).",

In northern Australia, it often grows in pastures and along road verges (Hussey et al. 1997). However, it can invade a variety of habitats from wetland margins to savanna (Csurhes & Hannan-Jones 2008).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "By replacing native grasses, Gamba Grass has a profound impact on savanna biodiversity. Firstly, Gamba Grass infestations lead to a loss in tree cover (Ferdinands et al. 2006) as a result of dramatically increased fire intensity produced by gamba grass fuelled fires. Furthermore, Gamba Grass alters nitrogen availability in the soil, leading to increased ammonium levels but decreased nitrate and total inorganic nitrogen levels (Rossiter-Rachor et al. 2009). Also water conditions were altered, with water use three times higher and deep drainage of water halved at Gamba Grass-infested sites (Rossiter et al. 2004). It can be assumed that if the areas invaded by Gamba Grass are very large, even the hydrology of a water catchment can be altered, with an impact on downstream wetlands and rivers (Csurhes & Hannan-Jones 2008).\n\nGamba Grass forms dense stands that produce high amounts of biomass. Consequently, savanna sites infested with Gamba Grass exhibit up to eight times higher fire intensities than native grass savannas (Rossiter et al. 2003). These high fire intensities can lead to a reduction of the tree layer and finally turn woodlands into grasslands (Csurhes & Hannan-Jones 2008). Furthermore, these intense fires are harder to control, leading to higher risks of property damage, loss of life and impacts to cultural sites (Csurhes & Hannan-Jones 2008).",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: If possible, Gamba Grass infestations should be removed when they are still small. Small plants can be pulled out or dug out, but care should be taken to shake soil from the roots to make sure that the plant dies (Queensland Government, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry).\n\nGamba Grass is a fire tolerant plant, but burning can be applied, especially early in the wet season, to remove old growth and reduce the establishment of young plants. The new growth after burns is also more susceptible to herbicides. Plants with seeds should not be burned to avoid further seed dispersal (Queensland Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry).\n\nChemical control: Herbicide treatment is best on plants that are still small or regenerating after burning or slashing. Gamba Grass is most susceptible to herbicides during flowering (Northern Territory Department of Land Resource Management). For effective chemical control, at least two treatments should be applied within a growing season. First, active growth after the onset of the we saison rains. Two to four weeks later, newly emerging seedlings and plants that were potentially missed should be sprayed. A further inspection before April is advisable to treat newly germinated seedlings and surviving plants, if necessary (Australian Weeds Committee 2011).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nIn order to avoid spread from Gamba Grass to other sites, hygienic procedures should be followed so that machinery etc. is not contaminated with seeds (Northern Territory Department of Land Resource Management).\n\nTo avoid regrowth from seeds, the site should undergo follow-up controls for two years after eradication (Flores 2005, Northern Territory Department of Land Resource Management).\n\nIn areas where the use of Gamba Grass is permitted, pastures should be well-grazed to keep plant height below 90 cm in order to minimize seed spread. Further spread of the species within or from the property should be avoided (Northern Territory Department of Land Resource Management 2010).\n\nBiological control: There is currently no known biological control agent.",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Lacy Ragweed (Ambrosia tenuifolia) is a very competitive plant, often to the detriment of crops and pasture and can result in reduction of the local flora and increased human allergic reactions. A weed of roadsides, waste areas, creek banks, pastures and uncultivated fields. As with the other Ambrosia species, it is noted for the amount of allergenic pollen it produces, causing severe hayfever and contact dermatitis in susceptible people (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nHuman health: The pollen contains highly potent allergens which cause respiratory allergies such as hay fever and can aggravate asthma (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Schaffner et al. 2020). This weed along with other species in the genus is a major cause of respiratory allergies in the United States, its native country.\n\nAgriculture: Lacy Ragweed is highly competitive and will invade crops and pastures. Negative impacts include crop losses, decrease in fodder availability. The aerial parts are known to be allelopathic, that is, the plant produces chemicals that inhibit germination and growth of other plant species. It is unpalatable to cattle and is not grazed by stock, so dense infestations can reduce pasture productivity considerably (Agriculture Victoria 2020; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Its burrs contaminate wool and are not easily removed during scouring. This adds to the cost of manufacture, because acid carbonate must be used for removal. The plant is also a problem in orchards, competing for nutrients, interfering with the harvest, and both pollen and burrs cause discomfort to pickers.\nNative ecosystems: Lacy Ragweed is mostly known from pastures and roadsides, but could potentially invade grasslands and grassy open vegetation.\nUrban areas: Lacy Ragweed spreads along roadsides and could invade townships and urban areas, including waste areas and abandoned land or gardens, impacting human health. As with the other Ambrosia species causes severe hayfever and contact dermatitis in susceptible people (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Hussey et al. 1997).",
    "controlMethods": "Lacy Ragweed (Ambrosia tenuifolia) can be managed similar to other perennial ragweed. Lacy Ragweed survives and spreads by spreading root-stocks and also by seeds.  Herbicides, however, give good control in pastures, suppressing the Lacy Ragweed and allowing pasture species to compete effectively. Slashing and mowing can be used, but is not effectively controlled by cultivation. In fact, it usually makes the infestation worse by spreading pieces of the perennial root and stimulating development from root buds. .\n\nChemical control: Spraying is usually performed at the budding stage of growth (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Herbicides, allow control but such treatments may need to be repeated over several years to prevent re-colonisation from dormant seeds in the soil (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In South Australia  Ragweeds are difficult to control requiring repeated application of herbicides such as triclopyr (Government of South Australia 2014). Foliar spray is used in New South Wales and South Australia, with information available at DPI NSW (2019) & Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018).\nPlease also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au.\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Where feasible, plants can be pulled by hand. However, contact with flowering plants and pollen should be avoided by those prone to allergies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical control: Lacy Ragweed survives mowing, trampling, grazing and cultivation due to the longevity and dormancy of its seed. Plants may be slashed or mown prior to setting seed (i.e. at the early flowering stage or immediately prior to flowering). Checks should be carried out to ensure flowering is prevented in any re-growth that occurs. Regrowth may occur from soil seed banks and these plants must also be controlled, normally with herbicides. \nCaution If plants have set seed , mechanical methods may make infestation worse, spreading seeds. Always use property hygiene practices when operating in areas infested with Lacy Ragweed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCultural: Lacy Ragweed is not effectively controlled by cultivation. In fact, it usually makes the infestation worse by spreading pieces of the perennial root and stimulating development from root buds. Young plant that have not developed a root system could be hand pulled.\nFire: With heavy infestations, opportunistic burning can be a useful tool in controlling Annual Ragweed if paddocks have not been overgrazed. Burning needs to be done when adequate soil moisture will allow good grass cover to grow back.\nBiological control: The Ragweeds has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Zygogramma bicolorata, a beetle, and Epiblema strenuana a stem gall moth, have both successfully established on Ragweeds in Queensland, to the north coast of New South Wales.",

    "habitat": "Perennial Ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) is mostly found in warmer temperate and sub-tropical environments. It is a common weed of pastures, open woodlands, roadsides, disturbed sites, waste areas, creek banks and riparian vegetation, and is occasionally also found growing in cultivation DEEDI (2020). Perennial Ragweed occurs in grasslands and other open vegetation, usually on lighter soils, often as a weed along roadsides, in uncultivated fields, vacant lots and waste lands (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In Queensland it is recorded as a weed of roadsides, waste areas, creek banks, pastures and uncultivated fields (Brisbane City Council, 2020).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Perennial Ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) is a strongly competitive plant often to the detriment of crops and pasture and can result in reduction of the local flora and increased human allergic reactions. A weed of roadsides, waste areas, creek banks, pastures and uncultivated fields (Brisbane City Council 2020).\n\nAgriculture: Perennial Ragweed is highly competitive and will invade crops and pastures. Negative impacts include crop losses, decrease in fodder availability (CABI 2020). The aerial parts are known to be allelopathic, that is, the plant produces chemicals that inhibit germination and growth of other plant species. It is unpalatable to cattle and is not grazed by stock, so dense infestations can reduce pasture productivity considerably (Agriculture Victoria 2020); Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Perennial Ragweed  is mostly known from pastures and roadsides, but could potentially invade grasslands and grassy open vegetation.\n\nUrban areas: Perennial Ragweed spreads along roadsides and could invade townships and urban areas, including waste areas and abandoned land or gardens, impacting human health. As with the other Ambrosia species, Perennial Ragweed is noted for the amount of allergenic pollen it produces, causing severe hayfever and contact dermatitis in susceptible people (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Hussey et al. 1997).",
    "controlMethods": "Perennial Ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) survives and spreads by spreading root-stocks and also by seeds. Herbicides can effectively be used to control\n\nChemical control: Herbicides, allow control but such treatments may need to be repeated over several years to prevent re-colonisation from dormant seeds in the soil (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In South Australia Perennial Ragweed is difficult to control requiring repeated application of herbicides such as triclopyr (Government of South Australia 2014). Foliar spray is used in New South Wales and South Australia, with information avalible at DPI NSW (2019) & Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA. (2018). Please also see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Where feasible, plants can be pulled by hand. However, contact with flowering plants and pollen should be avoided by those prone to allergies.\n\nMechanical control: Perennial Ragweed survives mowing, trampling, grazing and cultivation due to the longevity and dormancy of its seed. Plants may be slashed or mown prior to setting seed (i.e. at the early flowering stage or immediately prior to flowering). Checks should be carried out to ensure flowering is prevented in any re-growth that occurs. Regrowth may occur from soil seed banks and these plants must also be controlled, normally with herbicides.\nCaution If plants have set seed, mechanical methods may make infestation worse, spreading seeds. Always use property hygiene practices when operating in areas infested with Lacy Ragweed.\n\nCultural: Perennial Ragweed is not effectively controlled by cultivation. In fact, it usually makes the infestation worse by spreading pieces of the perennial root and stimulating development from root buds. Young plant that have not developed a root system could be hand pulled.\n\nFire: With heavy infestations, opportunistic burning can be a useful tool in controlling Annual Ragweed if paddocks have not been overgrazed. Burning needs to be done when adequate soil moisture will allow good grass cover to grow back.\n\nBiological control: The Ragweeds has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. Zygogramma bicolorata, a beetle, and Epiblema strenuana a stem gall moth, have both successfully established on Ragweeds in Queensland, to the north coast of New South Wales.",
    "origin": "Perennial Ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) is native throughout central Canada and the western half of the United States, with the exception of northern California, Oregon and Washington State but is prevalent throughout. Since World War II, it has become a serious weed in parts of eastern Europe, and western Asia. It also occurs in South America, Japan, Mauritius (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",
    "growthForm": "Herb",
    "similarSpecies": "Perennial Ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) is commonly mistaken for other Ambrosia species, in particular, Burr Ragweed (Ambrosia confertiflora). However, their seeds are very different, with the seed of Perennial Ragweed having a short beak surrounded by 4-5 short projections, and that of Burr Ragweed being covered with 10-20 short hooked spines (Thorp & Wilson 1998 -; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPerennial Ragweed is very similar to annual ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia). However annual ragweed does not produce underground stems (rhizomes), the fruiting involucre (a group of bracts surrounding the base of a flowerhead) is also smooth with out hairs (glabrous) or nearly so; leaves are always petiolate (with a leaf stalk).\n\nPerennial Ragweed fuiting involucre (a group of bracts surrounding the base of a flowerhead) is always distinctly hairy, and some leaves do not have a leaf stalk VicFlora (2016).",

Annual Ragweed is also a serious human health hazard due to the effects of allergenic pollen and can cause hayfever and asthma in humans ( Business Queensland 2016; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nHuman health: The pollen contains highly potent allergens which cause respiratory allergies such as hay fever and can aggravate asthma (CABI 2020; Palmer & McFadyen 2012; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Schaffner et al. 2020). This weed is a major cause of respiratory allergies in the United States, its native country (Bass et al. 2000). Annual Ragweed is also considered invasive in more than 30 countries in Europe and prior to 2013, 13.5 million people suffered from Ambrosia-induced allergies, causing costs of Euro 7.4 billion annually (Schaffner et al. 2020). In 1997, 30-40% of people sampled in the coastal city of Casino NSW, most of whom suffered allergenic symptoms during the Ragweed season, showed a positive skin test reaction to Ragweed pollen (Bass et al. 2000 In: Palmer and McFadyen 2012).\n\nAgriculture: Annual Ragweed can invade and develop into dense infestations in degraded and overgrazed pastures, reducing productivity. It is a fast-growing plant which can invade and suppress poorly managed pastures. Although cattle will eat Annual Ragweed to a small extent, other pasture species will be grazed in preference. Overgrazing will result in the loss of grass cover and a population explosion of Annual Ragweed and other weeds. It is unpalatable to horses and overgrazed horse paddocks often host large infestations (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nIn the United States it is a serious weed of cereal, maize, vegetable, sunflower, soybean and tobacco crops and can significantly reduce yields (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems: Known as a weeds of waterways and floodplains, (Palmer & McFadyen 2012).\n\nUrban areas: A weed of roadsides, waste places, vacant lots, and gardens.",

Annual Ragweed survives mowing, trampling, grazing and cultivation due to the longevity and dormancy of its seed.\n\nChemical control: A number of herbicides are registered for control of Annual Ragweed. As it has developed resistance to at least one herbicide in Europe, care should be taken to rotate the herbicides used to avoid this problem (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).

    "habitat": "Tumbleweed (Amaranthus albus) is naturalised in temperate to semiarid areas of Australia, although now found in sub-tropical humid areas such as southern Queensland. It is a weed of cultivation and wasteland, stream banks, roadsides and railway lines (Auld & Medd 1987; Walsh 1996; Department of Primary Industries and Water 2007). Tumbleweed is sometimes found in coastal areas or fringing salt lakes in southern Victoria (Walsh 1996).\n\nAcross its native range in the United States of America, Tumbleweed prefers dry barren areas with scant vegetation such as the dry gravel prairies and sand prairies that are found in Illinois (Hilty 2002-2006) so it is possible that it could expand its range into drier regions of Australia.",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Tumbleweed (Amaranthus albus) is a common weed in southern Australia from higher rainfall to in drier areas, but sometimes coastal or fringing salt lakes. It is a common weed of agricultural areas and habitation, and can form dense stands. Also a weed of disturbed areas by stream and creek banks, roadsides, along railway-lines and corridors, and  waste ground, and also in some native vegetation types. Normally inland in from higher rainfall to in drier areas, but sometimes coastal or fringing salt lakes.\n\nAgriculture: Tumbleweed is a serious weed of agriculture (Tasmania DPIW 2007) and crops. Each plant, depending on its size, can produce tens of thousands of seeds that can persist as a weed seed bank over several crop rotations (Costea & Tardif 2003).In North America it has been recorded as a host to various fungal and viral diseases, nematodes and insects that can cause considerable damage to crop plants (Costea & Tardif 2003). This has not been documented as yet in Australia but has the potential to be a problem for crops that are badly infested with Tumbleweed.\n\nNative ecosystems: Invades native vegetation normally open or degraded areas, especially so when those areas are surrounded by heavily infested agricultural or modified environments.\n\nUrban areas: Known to be common along transport corridors (roadsides, railway lines, tracks and by waterways). Is a weed of waste and abandoned areas and gardens.",
    "controlMethods": "There is limited information on Tumbleweed (Amaranthus albus) best practice management, but it is generally recommended that Tumbleweed is managed like any other summer growing annual dicot.\n\nChemical control: In general Amaranthus species are susceptible to a variety of selective and non-selective herbicides but resistant biotypes have been reported (Costea & Tardif 2003). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: is used especially in agriculture.\n\nHand pulling: Small infestations and individual plants may be removed by hand pulling or digging out, when small populations or areas are involved\nMechanical control: In the United States of America mowing or tillage has been suggested as useful methods of control (Nelson 2005-2007).",

Fat Hen has a similar growth form but the branches are less rigid; the leaves are toothed along the margins rather than entire/not toothed, the flowers are clustered in heads in the leaf axils as well as at the end of the branches and are not surrounded by spiny bracts.\n\nPrickly Saltwort or Roly-poly (Salsola australis) is also similar, having a rigid habit, spiny bracts around flowers and the habit of breaking off at the base once mature to roll around in the wind. It differs in having quite narrow, often succulent leaves, bracts around the flowers that are similar to the leaves and the flowers mature into a winged fruit that does not evenly split open like that of Tumbleweed (Palmer 2007, pers. comm.).",

    "habitat": "Khaki Weed (Alternanthera pungens) is found in tropical and subtropical regions growing mainly on light soils in areas of high temperatures. It also grows in cool temperate areas in southern Australia. Khaki Weed does particularly well colonising bare or disturbed areas and can be found in and around towns commonly occurring on nature strips, lawns, playing fields, caravan parks and saleyards (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is also found along road verges, crop and farm land, degraded pastures and disturbed natural vegetation (Spooner et al. 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Khaki Weed (Alternanthera pungens) is a thick ground cover with spiny burrs that can injure people and animals. It is claimed to also cause hay fever, asthma and dermatitis in some people (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nAgriculture: It can contaminate crops and devalue wool (DPI NSW 2019). In New South Wales Khaki Weed competes with both irrigated and dryland lucerne crops and the spiny burrs contaminate lucerne hay (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Khaki Weed is seldom a problem in well managed sown pastures but establishes occasionally in native pasture where it out-competes most other species (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).  The sharp spines of the fruit cause mechanical damage to the feet and mouths of stock and dogs and contribute to faults in wool (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Khaki Weed is believed to be poisonous to animals and to cause skin aliment in cattle. It is not readily eaten but sometimes young plants are consumed by sheep, apparently without ill effect (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nUrban areas: The deep tap root enables plants to survive drought conditions, but ample moisture in well irrigated recreation areas and caravan parks leads to vigorous growth. Attachment of the spiny fruit to animals, human footwear and car tyres is an important method of transport allowing Khaki Weed to quickly invade lawns, parklands, around bores, along river banks and wasteland areas (Miller & Schultz 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Widespread in wasteland, caravan parks, and recreation areas. Spines are a problem with dogs and stock but are particularly troublesome to humans and readily penetrate skin (DPI NSW 2019).  Barefooted humans also suffer from the spines penetrating the skin.  (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Not a known weed in native vegetation in Southern Australia but can be a weed in and occasionally also native pastures and grasslands and is regarded as an environmental weed in large parts of northern Australia (i.e. in northern Queensland, the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia (Brisbane City Council 2020; DEEDI 2020).",
    "controlMethods": "Khaki Weed (Alternanthera pungens) can be controlled by chemical and physical methods. Care should be taken when mowing and walking through infested areas as this will spread the seed (Miller & Schultz 1997).\n\nChemical control: Several chemicals are also available to control this weed (DPI NSW 2019; Miller & Schultz 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) and can be used as foliar spray. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Hand hoeing is effective if the bulk of the tap root can be removed. (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Weeds, including their roots, are physically pulled out of the ground by hand or using hand tools. This is an effective method of control for individual weeds and recent outbreaks that haven’t released seeds yet, but it requires a lot of labour.\n\nCultivation: Cultivation of the soil will destroy seedlings and established Khaki Weed plants but roots must be cut well below the soil surface to reduce the chance of regrowth. Follow-up cultivation is necessary to destroy new seedlings and any pieces of the new plants that survive.\n\nFire: Burning of an area after removal is effective in reducing the seed population.",

It is also similar to Gomphrena Weed or Soft Khaki Weed (Gomphrena celosioides) (Navie 2004), and small matweed (Guilleminea densa).\n\nGomphrena weed (Gomphrena celosioides) and small matweed (Guilleminea densa) may be distinguished by their lack of prickles, and gomphrena weed (Gomphrena celosioides) also by its larger whitish flower clusters that are borne at the tips of its branches (Brisbane City Council 2020).\n\nBindy Eye (Soliva sessilis) is a low-growing (i.e. prostrate) plant that produces prickles from its flower parts. However this species has very different, highly divided, leaves. Lesser Joyweed (Alternanthera denticulata), Common Joyweed (Alternanthera nodiflora) and Hairy Joyweed (Alternanthera nana) may have a low creeping habit and very similar flower clusters to Khaki Weed, but these species do not produce prickles. Gomphrena Weed may also be distinguished by its lack of prickles and by its larger, whitish-coloured, flower clusters that are borne at the tips of its branches (Navie 2004).",

    "habitat": "One of the reasons that Alligator Weed poses such a dramatic threat is its ability to live in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. It grows in creeks, rivers, ponds and drainage channels and thrives in nutrient-rich fresh water. It can also tolerate 10% sea-strength salinity or up to 30% salinity in flowing brackish water, e.g. adjacent to or in mangrove and beach areas in coastal regions. Ideal terrestrial habitats include places that are regularly inundated or that have high rainfall or irrigation\n\nIn water it roots either on the banks, or bottom of shallow water bodies, or floats freely on the water surface, with roots produced and trailing from the nodes on the stem . Over water, stems are up to 60 cm high and the stems between the leaves (internodes) are hollow aiding in flotation. Mats may extend 15 meters over the water surface and become so robust they can support the weight of a man (Ensbey 2004).\n\nOn land, stems are shorter and stems between the leaves (internodes) are smaller and much less hollow. Tap roots on land can reach depths exceeding 500 mm (CRC 2003a; Ensbey 2004).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Alligator Weed is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. It is an especially troublesome weed because it invades both land and water, and is very hard to control (CRC 2003a).\n\nAgriculture: Alligator Weed has greatly affected primary production having caused the failure of small crop and turf farms in parts of the lower Hunter region in New South Wales and is seriously threatening other turf, vegetable, tea tree and sugarcane industries in the rest of the state (Ensbey 2004).\n\nAnother infestation, in Barren Box Swamp, would have cost irrigation farmers in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area up to $250 million annually (if left unchecked (DPI, NSW 2019). So far, more than $3 million has been spent controlling this infestation alone (CRC 2003a).\n\nAlligator Weed contaminates grazing pastures and dense infestations restrict stock access to drinking water. In New Zealand and Australia, Alligator Weed causes photosensitisation of skin in light pigmented cattle, resulting in cancerous lesions. If present, land and associated production can be quarantined and sales restricted due to W1 weed status (Ensbey 2004).\n\nIn other parts of the world it is a major weed of transplanted rice wherever it is grown in the world. In China crop production is reduced between 20 to 63%. It impacts on hydro electric power production, fishing and has seriously degraded famous scenic spots.\n\nNative ecosystems, urban areas & infrastructure: When growing on land it competes with and displaces native flora species along river and creek banks and in wetlands, and can be harmful to animals. When growing in fresh water, Alligator Weed can cover the entire water surface, preventing flow, blocking up drainage channels and potentially increasing flood damage. Weed mats can impede the penetration of light and also reduce oxygen exchange, affecting aquatic flora and fauna and reducing water quality (CRC 2003a; Ensbey 2004).\n\nWhen growing in fresh water, Alligator Weed can cover the entire water surface, preventing flow, blocking up drainage channels and potentially increasing flood damage. Weed mats can impede the penetration of light and also reduce oxygen exchange, affecting aquatic flora and fauna and reducing water quality (CRC 2003a; Ensbey 2004).\n\nThe extraction industry in the Hawkesbury Nepean is also under threat. This industry supplies most of Sydney’s sand, gravel and soil resources. If contaminated the movement of these resources would be severely restricted (Ensbey 2004).\n\nThe impacts on water resources and infrastructure are great. Weed mats impede stream flow and lodge against structures thereby promoting sedimentation which contributes to flooding and structural damage.\n\nIt also has social impacts restricting access to and use of water, blocking and damaging pumps. Alligator Weed promotes health problems by providing habitats for mosquitoes and degrades natural aesthetics. It threatens water storage areas and also waterways associated with tourism and recreation where it creates a dangerous hazard for swimming and other water sports (Ensbey 2004).\n\nDPI NSW (2019) states that Alligator Weed is a problem in 30 countries. It is a serious weed in eight of these and a major weed in the others. In the USA floating alligator weed caused major impediments to navigation on the Mississippi River. In North Carolina aquatic infestations increased from 152 ha in 1963 to 1000 ha in 1999 along with a conservative estimate of 4000 ha of infested cropping land.",
    "controlMethods": "Seek advice from your local council or state/territory management agency to help you control Alligator Weed. The principle control methods are often a combination of chemical, physical, and biological methods.\n\nChemical control: DPI NSW (2019) report that Alligator weed is able to tolerate most herbicides, many herbicides have been trialled over the years for Alligator Weed control. It is now clear that there are important roles for specific herbicides in suppressing and depleting alligator weed and in assisting with eradication. Repeated herbicide treatments on land infestations have had the most success but they can be costly and must be ongoing. In water Alligator Weed is rarely completely killed by herbicides. Also, plants often break up after treatment leading to new infestations downstream. Using herbicides near waterways raises concerns about impact on non-target plants and the environmental health of the waterway (CRC 2003a; Ensbey 2004). Please see the DPI NSW WeedWise site for herbicide options for NSW: https://weeds.dpi.nsw.gov.au/Weeds/AlligatorWeed#biosecurity.\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: The value of physical controls (hand-pulling  or manual) is limited to small and isolated situations and could be particularly useful in removing initial invaders of a catchment if they can be located early enough. Mechanical control: Excavation of a small infestation will require at least the removal of 1-2 metres of soil from beneath the plant to ensure all root material is removed. However, other advice states that excavations should only be made to a depth of 20 cm due to the sheer volume of contaminated soil to be disposed of. An excavated site is then inspected regularly for signs of regrowth, which are then either treated with herbicide or removed by deep manual digging, depending on the management aim. Mechanical removal, particularly in waterways, is problematic and may contribute to downstream spread. Cultivation or slashing: Once alligator weed is established on land it cannot be controlled by cultivation or slashing. Any cultivation or slashing of infested land will only spread the infestation further as stem fragments root in soil or water and must be removed.  Councils and landowners in all states and territory may require a permit to remove and transport Alligator Weed.\n\nDisposal: The disposal of the collected material poses specific problems and material must be treated and disposed of securely. Plant material can be dried and incinerated, boiled or microwaved. Do not dispose of alligator weed in green waste or composting facilities. Large volumes of excavated contaminated soil are difficult to process, and if possible need to be spread on an impenetrable surface and dried prior to burial (preferably sealed in containers) at a secure disposal site that can be monitored for any signs of regrowth. Machine hygiene is essential when performing physical control to avoid accidental re-introduction or spread to new areas.\n\nBiological control: Alligator Weed was recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allowed activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. As a biological control the Flea Beetle (Agasicles hygrophila) was first introduced to Australia in 1976. It provides good control in aquatic environments in the Sydney region. Over the years floating mats of Alligator Weed has been successfully reduced the area of in the Georges River and in parts of the Hawkesbury Nepean system. This is a truly aquatic insect and is only effective in warm temperate and sub tropical areas that allow it to breed up to high numbers in early summer. One criticism of the flea beetle is the tendency for Alligator Weed to fragment when under attack, causing downstream spread. Plant fragments should be contained if downstream spread is an issue in areas where the flea beetles are active (NSW DPI 2019). A moth (Arcola malloi) contributes to control in aquatic habitats and is established but, like the Flea Beetle, has no impact on terrestrial Alligator Weed (Ensbey 2004). The role of these agents is therefore limited to ongoing suppression of extensive aquatic infestations. Biological control is not appropriate for eradication strategies. Further biological control programs are being explored (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nAlligator Weed has rarely, if ever, been successfully eradicated once it has infested a water body, despite numerous costly attempts. There has been some success with small infestations on land in suburban backyards. The highest priority for the management of Alligator Weed in Australia is an effective system of early detection and eradication before infestations become established. Management plans for large infestations of Alligator Weed should aim to contain and reduce population size, and prevent spread and establishment of new populations. Weed spreads so readily from fragments, and control methods are varied depending on site and size of population, so please contact your local council or state or territory weed management agency for advice (CRC 2003a).",

In particular Alligator Weed has often been confused with and grown instead of Mukunu-wenna (Alternanthera sessilis) which is favoured as a leafy green vegetable by the Sri Lankan community (Sainty 1998; Ensbey 2004). Without flowering material Alligator Weed can be hard to distinguish from other species of Alternanthera.\n\nOther non-related aquatic plants likely to be confused with Alligator Weed (leaves opposite, margins entire; flowers white, clustered together in a head on an axillary stalk (a stalk growing from the leaf joint (node) are:\n\nWater Primrose, Ludwigia peploides (leaves alternate, margins entire; flowers solitary, stalked, yellow);\n\nBlue Water Speedwell, Veronica anagallis-aquatica (leaves opposite, stem-clasping , margins toothed; flowers on a raceme, blue or lilac);\n\nEnydra fluctuans (leaves opposite, glossy, margins serrate or not; flower head sessile in leaf axil, yellowish);\n\nPersicaria species (leaves alternate, sometimes with a dark blotch in the centre; flowers on an elongated spike) (Sainty et al. 1998).\n\nCheck with your state or territory herbarium for advice on identification.",

    "impact": "Crow Garlic has an offensive garlic-like odour due to allyl sulphides. It is mostly a weed of agriculture, but also invades or is present in some native vegetation types, seen on roadsides, and occurs in urban areas.\n\nAgriculture: Crow Garlic gives a strong garlic odour and flavour to agricultural produce, particularly cereal grain, grain products, milk and meat. The garlic flavour appears in milk after only a few minutes grazing and it takes about 6 hours of feeding on non-infested pasture before the taint is lost (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The bulbils are difficult to remove from grain after harvest and contaminated grain is rejected at grain silos, but may be sold as stockfeed at a reduced price. The plant has the potential to have a significant impact on quality of produce due to contamination (Government of South Australia 2015). Classed as a contaminant by the Australian Wheat Board and contaminated wheat will be rejected at the silo. Similarly, contaminated barley is unacceptable for malting. Rejected grain might be sold as stockfeed but should not be fed to animals producing milk or meat. An additional problem is that infested grain milled for stockfeed often clogs the mills rollers (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Species of Allium rarely cause stock illness but Crow Garlic is suspected to have caused cattle poisoning in Britain. Cattle appear to be more susceptible than sheep to Allium poisoning. The toxic principles in Allium species cause anemia, disturbances in fat metabolism and enzyme activity in the liver. Problems are unlikely to arise if animals are offered a mixed diet.\n\nNative ecosystems:  Crow garlic (Allium vineale) is regarded as an environmental weed in South Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria. although Crow Garlic it is also spreading and becoming troublesome in natural habitats, this species is mainly seen as a pest of agriculture, (Queensland Government 2016) as recognised by Government of South Australia (2015). Crow garlic is also an invader of native vegetation, and is recorded  to occur in native vegetation (AVH 2021).\n\nUrban areas: A weed of roadsides and waste land. There have been cases of poisoning caused by the consumption of field garlic, in large quantities and by some mammals. Dogs seem to be particularly susceptible (Government of South Australia 2015).",
    "controlMethods": "Variations in dormancy and germination times of bulbs, bulbils and seeds of Crow Garlic make it well adapted for survival and difficult to control. A management program integrating grazing, cultivation and chemical control extending over at least five years may be required to eradicate this weed. A priority should be to prevent formation of aerial bulbils and seed to avoid further spread of infestations.\n\nChemical control: Crow Garlic can be killed by a number of herbicides but, as with cultivation, treatments must be repeated for several years to ensure all bulbs have germinated (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). A number of cheap herbicides routinely used in cereal cropping are effective against Crow Garlic in South Australia. It has disappeared from some areas since the introduction of sulfonylurea herbicides in the 1980s (Government of South Australia 2015).  A selection of herbicides are listed in Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001) and, Invasive Species Unit, Biosecurity SA (2018).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Removing individual or small plant id possible. However, all bulbs and bulbets should be removed and plants should be removed before bulbils drop from the flowering / bulbil heads.\n\nMechanical control: Cultivation can kill the majority of plants but needs to be repeated for several years to effectively eradicate the population. Cultivation is best used in conjunction with chemical treatments.\n\nCompetition and management: Heavy grazing by sheep or cattle achieves this but does not kill the underground bulbs or eliminate established infestations. Care should be taken due to the risk of stock poisoning. Frequent tillage in late autumn and spring reduces the food reserves of the bulbs, but care must be taken to avoid dragging bulbs to new areas (Fisher 2007).",
    "origin": "Crow Garlic is native to Europe, North Africa and Asia Minor and probably originated in the Balkans. It is an important weed of pastures, cereal crops and vineyards, causing problems in most temperate regions of the world (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Fisher 2007).",

    "impact": "Three-Cornered Garlic (Allium triquetrum)  is a weed of urban areas, roadsides pastures (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) and a variety of native vegetation. It is  most prominent in wetter shady sites and areas near watercourses (i.e. in riparian vegetation)  in South East Australia (Queensland Government 2016).  Three-Cornered Garlic is becoming an increasing problem as a riparian, bushland, roadside and domestic garden weed, as it can soon dominate the ground layer (Muyt 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nAgriculture: Three-Cornered Garlic does not compete strongly with crops and improved pastures, but imparts a strong onion flavour and unpleasant odour to dairy products and meat, making them unfit for sale. It takes about a day of grazing on non-contaminated feed before these taints are lost from milk.\n\nNative ecosystems:  Experience in Victoria has shown that three-cornered garlic can completely replace native ground vegetation in poorly drained soils along watercourses, especially under deciduous trees, growing with introduced perennial grasses or in pure stands that leave soil bare in its summer dormant period (Government of South Australia 2015).  It is known to have serious impacts on the natural habitats that it invades and is very aggressive, having the potential to rapidly occupy large tracts of land. Three-cornered garlic forms dense and persistent stands that totally dominate the ground-flora when conditions are suitable. These stands crowd out and displace the indigenous grasses and ground covers and can also seriously impede the regeneration of the over-storey vegetation (Queensland Government 2016).\n\nUrban areas: In urban areas it can invade native and ornamental parkland's, roadsides, abandoned sites and gardens, preferring organic rich soil, to poorly drained heavy soils, also surviving on some poorer soils in some areas.",
    "controlMethods": "Control of Three-Cornered Garlic  (Allium triquetrum) is difficult due to the high number of bulbs and bulblets in the soil. However, chemical and physical / mechanical methods can be used for control, but follow-up over several years is required in most cases.\n\nChemical control: In a bushland situation Three-Cornered Garlic can be spot sprayed with herbicide just before flowering. In an agricultural situation autumn and spring cultivation kills many plants but must be repeated for several years to ensure that all bulbs have germinated and are killed, effectively removing the area from cropping. A good method is to combine spring or autumn cultivation with spraying just before Three-Cornered Garlic flowers (Brown & Brook 2002; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: can  be used for single or few outliers, making sure to remove all bulbs. Not effective for larger populations\n\nMechanical control: Autumn and spring cultivation can be used  to kill plants normally in conjunction with follow-up spraying of chemicals.\n\nCompetition and management: Not normally a problem in well managed areas not subjected to over grazing.",

In Victoria and New South Wales, it is found mostly along drainage lines in irrigated pasture. Because Camel Thorn has roots that can extend 2-3 m into the ground, it can grow in dry, rocky, saline soil (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Jeanes 1996; Gardner 2002; Western Australia Department of Agriculture and Food undated).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: The vigorous root and rhizome system of Camel Thorn facilitates its spread and it has become a troublesome weed in other countries in cereal and horticultural crops where repeated cultivation aids its spread. In the United States it competes with, and eliminates, other vegetation including crop plants, preferred forage plants for stock and native species, and is itself grazed sparingly by stock.\n\nNative ecosystems:  It is unknown if the plant affects biodiversity in Australia, but presumably it would have some negative impact due to its invasive nature and impacts on native vegetation have been recorded in the United States (Thorp & Wilson 1998 – ; CWMA undated; Western Australia Department of Agriculture and Food undated).\n\nUrban areas: The rhizomes can extend under sealed roads and the shoots can break through bitumen.\n\nHealth: Positive impacts on human health are recorded: in the Middle East a sugary exudate from the leaves known as manna is used as a laxative, purgative, diuretic and expectorant while in India, oil from the leaves is said to relieve rheumatism (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).",
    "controlMethods": "Camel Thorn is a summer-growing species and is adapted only to very restricted habitats. It has proved unable to spread rapidly. It does not seed every year, is grazed by cattle in the growing season, and most infestations have been destroyed since picloram came into use (SA DEW, 2020).\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual removal: of Camel Thorn, especially in established patches, is only effective if all fragments of rhizomes capable of developing into whole new plants are removed.\n\nChemical control: Herbicides that act through the soil will control Camel Thorn, but this method of treatment is problematic because it also affect other plants. Consequently, it is important that Camel Thorn is controlled before it establishes among valuable crop or stock plants or in native vegetation. Because of the extensive rhizome system, areas treated with herbicides need to be checked in subsequent years for regrowth.

It spreads readily in disturbed sites (farmland, railway lines, roadside etc.) and along watercourses. It grows well in poor soils and full sunlight (GISD 2005). It is tolerant of shade and has been reported growing on the banks of the Colo River in New South Wales, under dense native vegetation (Rodd 2002). It is known to grow in very thin soils and tolerate a wide range of pH levels. It can tolerate drought and saline soils (Hoshovsky 1988).  It will establish in urban areas, sending suckers some distance under paths or even small roads.",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima) exhibits typical characteristics of an invasive weed. It has efficient dispersal and reproductive qualities and the ability to form dense monocultures (Call & Nilsen 2005). Tree-of-heaven is a deciduous tree with a tendency to sucker extensively from its roots, forming dense thickets and outcompeting other desirable plants (DPI NSW 2019). This species primarily occurs in disturbed areas, but its winged seeds can blow considerable distances and it may also invade undisturbed habitats (DEEDI 2020).\n\nIt is mildly toxic to humans with mild symptoms of headache and nausea if ingested in large quantities. The sap is a skin and eye irritant causing rashes, dermatitis and conjunctivitis, and the pollen can cause allergic reactions such as hay fever (DPI NSW 2019). The toxicity levels are highest in the leaves during the early part of the growing season (Mergen 1959; GISD 2005). It inhibits post-disturbance succession by other plants by creating a relatively toxic soil environment (Lawrence et al. 1991).\n\nAgriculture: Not a known weed of agriculture as cultivation and cropping do not allow for its establishment. However, it can sucker from planted stands in homesteads and other areas growing under fence lines. The species has toxins in its bark, leaves and flowers which inhibit the growth of other plants, and are toxic to animals.\n\nNative ecosystems:  Tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) is regarded as an environmental weed in New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia . It spreads into bushland from old homestead sites and other plantings, and is particularly invasive in riparian vegetation and along gullies and can also invade dry sclerophyll forests and other woodlands (DEEDI 2020). Tree-of-heaven out-compete native species for nutrients and light, often completely displacing these species and forming monospecific (single) stands. Is an aggressive competitor due to its allelopathic properties (inhibits germination of other seeds), ability to tolerate a wide range of soils, and the abundant suckers it produces from shallow roots. Will shade out smaller plants and spreads rapidly via highly viable wind dispersed seed (Brown & Bettink 2009). For example, in Wellington, New South Wales, it is likely to overtake the rocky outcrop on which the rare species Zieria obcordata occurs and out-compete numerous other native species (Bannerman 2005).\n\nUrban areas:  Can sucker in garden and roadside spreading to neighbouring land even under roads.  It can withstand harsh urban environments better than most plants (Parsons and Cuthbertson 1992). The roots of Tree-of-heaven can also damage piping and foundations (GISD 2005).",
    "controlMethods": "If possible, Tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima) is best controlled in the early stages of establishment by seed. If not removed, larger plants  will sucker from the roots when the main plant is cut down or poisoned, and may continue to do so for some years. For this reason, repeat treatment with herbicide will be necessary.\n\nChemical control: Various herbicide are effective and available for application via various methods. Plants too big for manual removal, but still small plants  should be foliar sprayed. For small-medium sized young plants the basal bark method can be used, and for older large plants the cut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment, cut and painted) or the stem injected method can be used.\n\nFoliar spraying: Spay all leaves of young small plants with systemic herbicide. Basal barking: Starting at the base of each stem, paint all the way around the stem to a minimum height of 30 centimetres ensuring the treated area is not disturbed for at least 24 hours to allow herbicide uptake. This method can take weeks to months. Stem injection (drill-and-fill): Using a drill or similar tool cut downward at an angle of 45 degrees through the bark to the sap wood.  Immediately apply the herbicide mixture penetrating the trunk to a depth which reaches the sapwood and they must be angled downwards to enable the herbicide to pool. Take care not to overfill the holes. and ensure the treated area is not disturbed for 24 hours to allow herbicide uptake. Treat each stem of the plant with cuts every 7.5 centimetres around the trunk's entire circumference. Create two rows of pockets around the tree (one slightly higher, the next row lower and offset from the first). Cut-and-swab method (Cut stump treatment or cut and painted): Cut the stem  no more than 15 centimetres from the ground and immediately apply the herbicide mixture to the cut surface of the stump. If you do not apply the herbicide immediately the plant will seal itself off and the herbicide will not enter the plant.\n\nFor a summary of treatment and applications see; DPI NSW 2019.  Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au. NOTE: Training is normally a requirement in most States and Territories for all or some of the methods.\n\nNon-chemical control: Non chemical control methods are usually followed up with chemical (herbicide) applications. Do not cut trees down without applying herbicide to the stump or massive suckering will result. Physical control: Manual removal of young seedlings is the best way to remove the future problem. Small seedlings and the roots can be pulled out of the ground after rain when the soil is loose. This facilitates removal of the entire rooting system, which may otherwise re-sprout if left in the ground. If left until the taproot develops, total removal of the roots system will be difficult (Hoshovsky 1988).\n\nPloughing, or slashing of small plants, will also result in massive suckering so is not advised. Burning is not recommended as the trees will re-sprout vigorously after fire (Burch & Zedaker 2003).\n\nBiological control: There are currently no biological controls for Tree-of-heaven.",

    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Mistflower is a significant environmental weed in New South Wales and Queensland.\n\nAgriculture: In south-eastern Queensland it spreads into pastures and reduces the carrying capacity significantly. Abandoned banana plantations are a stronghold for Mistflower. Mistflower is deemed to have no feed value and there are no field reports of animals dying from the consumption of this plant. However, in laboratory tests, alcohol extracts of this plant have killed sheep while horses fed the plant have developed palpable nodules in the lungs (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Land Protection 2006). It can spread into wetter pastures, significantly reducing their carrying capacity. It may also restrict the movement of livestock and farm machinery (Queensland Biosecurity 2016).\n\nNative ecosystems: Mistflower spreads into bushland displacing native vegetation. It will quickly invade disturbed areas on frost-free slopes and dominate riverine groundcover habitats, excluding many native species and the native animals which are reliant upon the native plants. It is especially invasive in gullies and riparian habitats and is often reported to dominate the groundcover vegetation along waterways. It is shade tolerant and can almost totally exclude native plants in these areas, an may even displace many of the animals which were reliant upon those plants.\n\nSeveral rare and endangered native plants are also thought to be threatened by mistflower (Ageratina riparia) in New South Wales. The ravine orchid (Sarcochilus fitzgeraldii), which is restricted to few sites in wet sclerophyll forests and rainforest ecotones in north-eastern New South Wales, and Hartman's sarcochilus (Sarcochilus hartmannii), an epiphytic orchid from south-eastern Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales, are two important examples. The endangered Border Ranges daisy (Brachyscome ascendens) and the vulnerable giant spear lily (Doryanthes palmeri) are two more species from this region that are known to be treatened by mistflower (Ageratina riparia). A dense groundcover of this weed has been reported in sites where giant spear lily (Doryanthes palmeri) grows in northern New South Wales, and its faster growth rate is likely to enable it to out-compete the native plant in most situations. At Mount Cordeaux in south-eastern Queensland, where mistflower (Ageratina riparia) is spreading down a whole cliff-face, it appears to be displacing giant spear lily (Doryanthes palmer) (Biosecurity Queensland 2016).\n\nFurther south, the Illawarra irene (Irenepharsus trypherus) is also threatened by weeds, and mistflower (Ageratina riparia) has invaded some of the locations where this superficially similar rare native species still grows. Weed invasion is also regarded as a major threat to the integrity of Illawarra sub-tropical rainforest in the Sydney Basin bioregion, and one of the invasive exotic species that is threatening this ecological community is mistflower (Biosecurity Queensland 2016).",
    "controlMethods": "It is recommended to  not overgraze pasture in the first place to help prevent the establishment of Mistflower.\n\nChemical control: Aerial application of fertiliser in steep country produces thick pasture, which will provide strong competition for mistflower. Re-establishment of pasture, where necessary, after herbicidal control is recommended to restrict seedling regeneration and prevent erosion. Newly established pastures preferably should not be grazed until they have seeded. (DAF Queensland 2020). Any regrowth of mistflower should be spot sprayed. Mistflower is resistant to some herbicides and for long-term control herbicide treatment may need to be repeated (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Land Protection 2006).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Mistflower can be controlled mechanically through hoeing, grubbing and burning but it is essential that replacement pasture plants or native plants be sown on the treated areas to prevent re-establishment of the weed. Mechanical removal is not always practical and herbicides may be used.\n\nMistflower has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. The Gall-forming Fly Procecidochares alani was introduced to Australia in 1987 as a biocontrol agent for Mistflower but with limited success as it is parasitized by native wasps. Other biological agents have been useful control agents in Hawaii and New Zealand but do not appear to have been released in Australia (Zancola et al. 2000).\n\nRed-necked Pademelons in disturbed and regenerating rainforests on the Springbook plateau in south-eastern Queensland browse extensively on Mistflower. This browsing and physical damage breaks up the broad stands of Mistflower and creates the potential for native species to re-establish (Zancola et al. 2000).",

Crofton weed also occurs in temperate areas, normally in damp to riparian areas.",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Crofton Weed (Ageratina adenophora) is a rapid-spreading weed that has become a nuisance in many areas along the eastern coast of Australia, emerging as a weed in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia . It is particularly invasive on cleared land that is not grazed, such as public reserves, and causes particular problems for horse owners as its poisonous to horses. Crofton weed is commonly found include: land cleared but not revegetated with pasture, roadsides and waste areas, ungrazed small holdings, state forests, national parks, abandoned banana plantations, fencelines. Once established, seedlings tolerate shade and grow rapidly. In this way, small infestations of Crofton weed rapidly increase in size unless controlled (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nAgriculture: Crofton Weed is an aggressive weed of pastures, affecting the carrying capacity of grazing lands, and also affects crop yield. Cattle find Crofton Weed unpalatable but sheep and goats eat it without ill effect (DPI NSW 2019). It prefers wetter pastures (e.g. kikuyu grass pastures on wetter slopes), is usually not eaten by cattle, and can reduce the carrying capacity and productivity of invaded areas (Queensland Government 2016). However, it is poisonous to horses, causing acute swelling of the lungs which leads to hemorrhaging and death. In Queensland the disease is called \"Tallebudgera Horse Disease\" and in New South Wales it is known as \"Numinbah Horse Sickness\" (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Land Protection 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: In ungrazed lands such as public reserves and native bush it reduces the ecological value of bushland (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Trounce & Dyason 2003; Land Protection 2006). Crofton weed is an aggressive invader of public amenity land such as State forests, national parks and nature reserves, as well as public utility easements such as railway embankments. It it is also commonly found in urban bushland, open woodlands\n\nUrban areas: It is also an aggressive weed on cleared areas,  and disturbed areas, examples being; creeklines, riparian areas; roadsides, parks and amenity areas and in reserves and parks in peri-urban to urban areas.",
    "controlMethods": "Crofton weed can be controlled by chemical and no chemical means, via physical removal and mechanical management. The main control methods are slashing and mowing and chemical (herbiside) treatments when actively growing,  In Australia, despite a vigorous and sustained programme of control, Crofton Weed still persists in significant amounts in the coastal area surrounding the New South Wales and Queensland border. This may in part be due to the preference of the weed for steeply sloping frost-free land, a major factor in limiting mechanical and high volume chemical treatments, while the danger of drift onto neighbouring horticultural crops precludes aerial application of herbicides.\n\nChemical control: Chemical control is effective and appears to work best during late summer and autumn when weeds are actively growing (Trounce & Dyason 2003; Land Protection 2006). A combination of slashing and chemical application is often used to eradicate Crofton weed. After slashing, the weed is allowed to regrow from the crown to a height of 15–40 cm and then sprayed with herbicide. Combined with the introduction of competitive species, this strategy restores the productivity of infested land (DPI NSW 2019). Please see DPI NSW (2019) and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for further chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au .\n\nNon-chemical control: Physical control: Small areas of scattered Crofton Weed plants can be physically removed with care being taken to remove roots to prevent regrowth. Small areas of scattered plants can be dug out with a mattock. Crowns must be removed to prevent regrowth.\n\nMechanical control: Larger areas of Crofton Weed can be controlled by cultivation. Slashing reduces seed set as well as the general vigour of plants which gives more vigorous pastures a chance to establish. Slashing is often used to control heavy infestations on accessible land. Regular slashing will reduce flowering and seedset, thus reducing spread by seeds. It will also reduce the vigour and density of Crofton weed infestations and, combined with competitive pastures, will eventually bring them under control. The slashed and dried plant, however, is still attractive and toxic to horses. Take care to keep horses away until the plant has been completely removed from the paddock (DPI NSW 2019).\nCompetition and management:  Well-managed, competitive pastures are important in preventing weed invasion and this principle also applies to Crofton weed. Dense pasture swards suppress seed germination and livestock eat young seedlings with the balance of their feed. Therefore, fewer plants grow to maturity. Goats are known to eat Crofton weed (DPI NSW 2019). Crofton weed can be controlled using a combination of methods, in conjunction with pasture and grazing management practices, aimed at creating an unfavourable environment for weed invasion (DPI NSW 2019).\nBiological  control: Crofton Weed has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls. A gall-forming fly (Procecidochares utilis) was released in Queensland in about 1953 to control the plant and successfully established. However, its impact is variable as it is parasitised by a native wasp. A native crown-boring insect (Dihammus argentatus) and an accidentally introduced fungus (Cercospora eupatorii) also attack Crofton Weed. However, although affecting the vigour of plants, these controls are not highly effective and cannot be relied upon (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Trounce & Dyason 2003). Also, the biological control programmes have shown limited effectiveness because of the effect of indigenous parasitic insects on the introduced predators (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

Furthermore, its stems have only a few, fine hairs while the young stems of Crofton Weed are densely covered in sticky glandular hairs. The leaves of Mistflower are narrower and elongated rather than diamond or trowel-shaped as in Crofton Weed (Navie 2004).",

The leaves and roots are poisonous and can cause ulceration of the mouth.\n\nNative ecosystems: Agapanthus invades bushland and roadside vegetation. It forms dense stands, where its dense clumping roots displace all other vegetation and smother native ground-covers, prevent regeneration of trees and shrubs, and eliminate habitat for native fauna. It has been promoted as a fire-resistant plant for residential gardens in fire-prone areas since the lush clumps are likely to be very fire retardant (ACTPLA 2005). However, it could also have an impact on fire frequency in native vegetation, making infested bush difficult to burn.\n\nUrban areas: Agapanthus invades gardens and can spread vegetatively over many years, also slowly spreading along roadsides.

    "controlMethods": "Prevention: Preventing seed dispersal is important in the control of Goatgrasses, as once established they can be difficult to control. The barbed seeds can attach to fur or wool of livestock, therefore grazing animals should be removed from infested areas before plants reach maturity and flower. Feeding contaminated grain to livestock can also increase the spread of Goatgrasses as the seeds of Jointed Goatgrass are able to remain viable even after passing through the gut. Certified seed should be used to avoid planting Goatgrasses (Encycloweedia 2008).\n\nNon-chemical control: Mechanical control such as mowing can be used to reduce seed production. Mowing must be conducted after flowering and before seeding. Early mowing may result in new growth, and late mowing may increase the spread of seeds (Encycloweedia 2008). As Goatgrasses generally mature later than native annual grass species, burning can be used in non-cropping situations as an effective control method without disrupting annual grass seed production (Encycloweedia 2008).\n\nChemical control: There are currently no known selective herbicides for Goatgrasses in cropping situations (Encycloweedia 2008), but non-selective herbicides are effective for smaller infestation (WSNWCB 2008).\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

      "Sorrel (Acetosella vulgaris) is a native plant of western and central Europe that has widely naturalised in southern and eastern Australia.",
      "It is a slender upright, rhizomatous perennial.",
      "Plants bear either male or female flowers.",
      "It is hard to eradicate because of its extensive rhizomatous root system.",
      "It is an agricultural and environmental weed, best controlled through an integrated management program."
    ],
    "description": "",
    "leaves": "",
    "flowers": "",
    "fruit": "",
    "reproduction": "",
    "habitat": "Sorrel is a widespread weed of pastures, cultivation and around settlements in the cooler high rainfall areas of Australia (Archer & Martin 1979; Archer & Auld 1982). It has become established, often associated with disturbance, in natural areas in woodlands, open forests, grasslands and on riverbanks (Kodela & Wilson 2007, pers. comm.).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Agriculture: Sorrel is strongly competitive in low-growing pastures, crops and other disturbed sites, but it can be out-competed by taller, vigorous-growing crops and pasture species (Hyde-Wyatt & Morris 1975, Sainty & Associates 2003). It is unpalatable and seldom grazed and may become locally dominant in temperate pastures. It contains oxalates and is suspected of poisoning stock although generally levels are unlikely to be high enough to kill stock (Everist 1973; Archer & Martin 1979; Weeds Australia undated). Its numerous small seeds are a common impurity in agricultural seed lots, but can be removed by seed-cleaning equipment (Archer & Martin 1979).\n\nNative ecosystems: It occurs to a limited extent in natural habitats, including alpine herbfields, but has more trouble growing there than in disturbed situations (Pickering et al. 2003). Sorrel invades a wide variety of natural habitats including  dry coastal vegetation, heathlands, heathy woodlands, grasslands, grassy woodlands, dry sclerophyll forests, wetlands, rocky outcrops, and sub-alpine and alpine vegetation (Weeds of Australia 2016).\n\nUrban environments: Sorrel is a troublesome garden weed.",
    "controlMethods": "Non-chemical control: Sorrel can be controlled more effectively by cultivation and grazing practices and selective use of fertilisers and taller-growing pasture species than by use of herbicides (Archer & Martin 1979; Archer & Auld 1982). Manual removal is rarely successful and extremely difficult due to the extensive rhizomatous root system and attempts often lead to greater infestations (Herbiguide n.d.).\n\nBiological control: Sorrel has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.\n\nChemical control: Sorrel can be reduced by the use of herbicides but most likely not eradicated. Other countries have used a variety of chemicals to various success.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information at http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "There are about 200 species in the genus Rumex in the broad sense (including the Sorrels as well as the docks) and nearly all parts of the world have native species. In Australia there are 7 native species and about as many again introduced. Sorrel is native to Europe and north-western Africa; it is very widely introduced around the world, especially in temperate regions (Wilson 1990; Wilson submitted).",

    "similarSpecies": "Sorrel Acetosella vulgaris [as Rumex acetosella] is unlikely to be confused with any other dock species.

    "reproduction": "",
    "habitat": "Rambling Dock grows in pasture, wasteland, gardens and other disturbed or modified habitats, as well as invading a variety of native ecosystems including forests, woodlands, rainforest, riparian environments (e.g. along rocky creeks and streams), grassland, coastal or near-coastal shrublands, coastal bluffs and hind-dunes; especially near urban areas. Plants favour damp or seasonally moist sites and are tolerant of periodic inundation of water. While shade tolerant, growth is most vigorous in open, sunny conditions (Walsh 1996; Wilson 2000; Muyt 2001; Weber 2003; Harden et al. 2007; Western Australian Herbarium 2007).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Rambling Dock is a major weed of gardens, disturbed sites and urban bushland that grows rapidly and smothers supporting vegetation, preventing its regeneration, and therefore reducing native species richness (Muyt 2001; Sainty and Associates 2002; Weber 2003).\n\nIn one study in the northern Sydney area, Rambling Dock was found to be one of the most common exotic species growing in a sclerophyll woodland, and was primarily located in areas that were nutrient-enriched by run-off from nearby residential developments Weeds of Australia 2016). Rambling Dock is threatening the survival of endangered native plant species. For example, the native she-oak Allocasuarina portuensis only occurs naturally in foreshore vegetation in Nielsen Park, within the Sydney Harbour National Park. Rambling dock (Rumex sagittatus) was one of six invasive weed species dominating the understorey vegetation of this site, and it is thought that the dense groundcover of weeds may be preventing the regeneration of this endangered species (Weeds of Australia 2016).",
    "controlMethods": "Rambling dock can be difficult to control because it is a prolific seeder and regenerates from underground tubers if the top growth is removed. The underground tubers can be very difficult to locate and remove when attempting to control infestations of this species, and it is important that seed capsules and tubers are disposed of carefully to prevent them being spread (Weeds of Australia 2016).\n\nNon-chemical control: Manual control: Seedlings and small plants can be dug out, but you need to make sure that all tubers and rhizomes must be removed. Plants regrow from tubers, and these are hard to locate and dislodge easily (Sainty and Associates 2002; Weber 2003). Removing fruits before they ripen will help prevent seed dispersal.\n\nFire: Though fire may sometimes be used in such areas as a tool for controlling exotic weeds, it was found that it could maintain its presence post-fire through vegetatively re-sprouting from its underground tubers (Weeds of Australia 2016).\n\nChemical control: Is also best done before fruits ripen, and repeated applications over several years are necessary for effective control. (Muyt 2001; Weber 2003; Sydney Weeds Committees undated). See the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",
    "origin": "Rambling Dock is native to southern Africa, from Malawi and Zambia to South Africa (Hyde & Wursten 2008).",
    "growthForm": "Vine",
    "similarSpecies": "Rambling Dock is related to Acetosa vesicaria (known as Rosy Dock, Bladder Dock or Ruby Dock), which is widely naturalised in more arid parts of Australia. Rosy Dock is an erect tufted annual herb with fibrous roots, while Rambling Dock is a perennial climber with thick tuberous roots (Auld & Medd 1992; Wilson 2000; Richardson et al. 2006).\n\nThe leaves of the native climbers, Greater Bindweed (Calystegia sepium) and Forest Bindweed (Calystegia marginata), may appear similar to vegetative Rambling Dock in shape, but both these species have smooth, non-ribbed stems and large, solitary, white or pink flowers; they are usually found in moist settings (Muyt 2001).",

It crowds and shades out native plants in sensitive bushland along watercourses, and has become a major riparian weed of a some waterways. It is also thought that dense long-term infestations of this species may cause significant damage to waterways by trapping sediment, causing erosion and depleting oxygen levels in the water as a result of shedding large quantities of autumn leaves. It is a successful and persistent invader once established, displacing native shrubs and trees and preventing their regeneration (Weber 2003). Box Elder is quick growing and out-competes other vegetation, mainly by shading, its extensive root system, and creation of a heavy leaf-fall (Blood 2001).\n\nUrban areas: Also a weed in amenity areas and park and gardens, and can come up en-mass in garden beds. The root system seeks water and can invade pipes (Blood 2001).",

    "habitat": "Starburr is found in the humid and subhumid tropics in a wide range of habitats and is commonly a weed of disturbed ground and areas, especially near settlements. It occurs on roadsides, in waste places, stockyards, around silos, stock routes, in pastures and cultivation, as well as natural vegetation areas such as grassland and woodland. It is often found on creek flats, alluvial flats and usually on sandy soils, but may also occur on heavier clay soils (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Stanley & Ross 1986; Murray 1992; Weed Technical Working Group 1999; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Smith 2002).",
    "distribution": "",
    "impact": "Starburr is A weed of pastures, crops, disturbed sites, roadsides and waste areas in the warmer (i.e. tropical, sub-tropical and semi-arid) climatic regions of northern Australia (Biosecurity Queensland 2016).\n\nAgriculture: Starburr has various impacts on agriculture. It invades and competes with crops (e.g. sugarcane, pineapple, cotton, soybeans, sunflowers, rice, wheat, peanuts and vegetables in overseas countries; tobacco, sugarcane, maize and sorghum in northern Australia) and pastures, and will take over disturbed land, overgrazed areas, riverbanks and areas around bores and yards (Holm et al. 1997; Miller & Schultz 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Smith 2002). Competition from weeds for space, light, water and nutrients reduces agricultural yields and productivity. Dense patches in pastures reduce the area available for grazing. It is not grazed by stock and it can impede harvesting (Weed Technical Working Group 1999; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is also contaminant of harvested material such as hay (Miller & Schultz 1997). The seeds and leaves contain chemical compounds called phenolic acids that leach out from them and inhibit germination and the root and shoot growth of some crops (Holm et al. 1997).\n\nThe burrs are a troublesome and serious contaminant in wool (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) and are a possible contaminant of crop and pasture seeds (Friend 1983). The sharp spines on the burr cause discomfort to humans and animals (Miller & Schultz 1997). Its presence in seedling stage at maize-harvesting time is a nuisance to harvesters (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977). The burrs injure stock by penetrating the hooves which may lead to the wound getting infected and result in lameness (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The spines can also cause skin lesions (Holm et al. 1997).\n\nPlants may cause stock poisoning due to their nitrate levels (Holm et al. 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It can be toxic to animals, e.g. mice and goats, when consumed daily (Holm et al. 1997).\n\nIt acts as an alternative host to a number of plant pests and diseases that attack crops, including the cotton insect pest Calidea dregii, a tomato leaf curl transmitted by white flies, and the wilt-causing pathogen Verticillium albo-atrum (Friend 1983; Holm et al. 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Where Starburr invades natural vegetation it may form dense infestations that out-compete the more desirable native species (Smith 2002). It is known to invade native rangeland pastures and out-compete more desirable native species, particularly along waterways and on nearby floodplains. This not only has a negative impact on the productivity of these pastures but also effects their biodiversity. Starrburr has also invaded national parks and aboriginal lands, where it may cause even more significant environmental damage. For example, it is seen as a threat to the Flora River Nature Park in the northern parts of the Northern Territory because it is common in surrounding areas and could easily invade the park through flood waters, feral animals, wandering stock, vehicles and visitor activities (Biosecurity Queensland 2016).",
    "controlMethods": "Chemical control: There are many herbicides that can be directly applied to control Starburr (an extensive list is provide heree https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/2465). Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au\n\nNon-chemical control: Isolated plants and small populations can be physically controlled by removing the plants by hand or digging and then burning or deeply burying the material. Monitoring of the area and follow-up controls may be required to remove any new seedlings. Starburr is an annual, so preventing it from seeding will eventually eliminate it. Cultivation or slashing is effective if undertaken prior to seed set, but if left till after seed set these actions could spread the plant instead. Where cultivation is practicable, the field needs to be ploughed to bury any existing seeds at least 10 cm below the surface and then sown with a suitable perennial pasture, preferably a species that provides a dense surface cover and shading. Any weed seedlings sprouting from the newly sown pasture must be removed as soon as practicable. Plants can also be effectively controlled by chemicals (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Miller & Schultz 1997; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nQuarantine will be an integral part of any control program. All animals brought on to a property, as well as those moved from infested to burr-free parts of the property, must be checked and any burrs removed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The spread to uninfested 'clean' areas can be controlled by only using hay that is free of the weed and its seed (Miller & Schultz 1997).",
    "origin": "Starburr is native to Central America (i.e. Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), parts of the Caribbean and tropical South America (i.e. French Guiana, Guyana, Surinam, Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay and northern Argentina) (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Biosecurity Queensland 2016).",

The related Paraguayan Starburr (Acanthospermum australe), also known as Paraguay Burr, Paraguay-bur, Paraquay-starbur or Sheepbur, is a prostrate herb with shorter leaves and the burr lacks the two spreading spines at the tip (Auld & Medd 1992; Murray 1992).",

Clumps of this prickly plant can also provide refuge for pest animals such as rabbits. Its spiny, often dense nature also provides bird nesting sites that are secure from predators (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In common with other wattles, it is likely that the ability to produce hard, long-lived seeds that creates the potential for mass germination in the event of fire or soil disturbance also enables Kangaroo Thorn to naturalise outside its native range (McDonald et al. 2001; Reid 2008, pers. comm.).",

This can be achieved by dozing or cutting plants at or below ground level, which usually kills them.\n\nGrazing: Browsing by goats considerably reduces plant size and, in time, most plants will die.\n\nCultivation and management: In agricultural situations the establishment of a competitive pasture will reduce the re-establishment of Kangaroo Thorn seedlings (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nChemical control: Where chemical control is required, a suitable chemical can be applied as an overall spray to plants in full leaf.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

This is also the common name for Vachellia nilotica, an introduced wattle from India that is a declared weed in all Australian states and territories. Because it is a shrub or tree that grows to 12 m high with bipinnate (“feathery” or “fern-like”) leaves, Vachellia nilotica will not be confused visually with Kangaroo Thorn. However, the two species could be confused if they are referred to by common names only.

It is a very serious threat to heathland and heathy woodland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, and riparian vegetation (Carr et al. 1992). Cootamundra Wattle is reported to hybridise with at least six other Australian wattles thereby threatening the integrity of native wattle populations through genetic pollution. Two of the species it is known to hybridise with, Early Black Wattle (Acacia decurrens) and Silver Wattle (Acacia dealbata), are also environmental weeds outside their native ranges.

Several years are required to exhaust its soil-stored seed bank and prevent more seeds being added to it.\n\nPhysical control: Seedlings of Cootamundra Wattle can be hand-pulled and small plants dug out. Older mature plants do not usually re-shoot, so they can be ring-barked or cut down without herbicide application. Fire destroys plants and stimulates seed germination, enabling the resulting seedlings to be manually removed or sprayed. Follow up treatments will be required for several years (Muyt 2001). Because the seeds of Cootamundra Wattle are bird spread, treat plants before they fruit. Bag and remove all pods (Weeds of the Blue Mountains website).\n\nChemical control: A range of herbicide treatments can also be used. Younger plants can be treated by cutting stems back to near ground level and painting the cut stem with a suitable herbicide (the cut-paint method) or by injecting a suitable herbicide into drill holes at the base of the plant (the drill-fill method). Seedlings and smaller plants can be sprayed with selective and non-selective herbicides.\n\nPlease see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au",

    "similarSpecies": "Cootamundra Wattle is generally similar to other bipinnate wattles. However, the silvery grey-green or blue-green leaves should separate it from most similar species. It can be distinguished from Silver Wattle (Acacia dealbata), a widespread wattle with similar-coloured foliage, by its relatively short leaves with usually only 2-4 (sometimes up to 6) pairs of leaflets. Silver Wattle has longer leaves with up to 20 (sometimes more) pairs of leaflets (Entwisle et al. 1996; Kodela & Tindale 2001; Kodela & Harden 2002). The formation of hybrids, with other bipinnate wattles (including Silver Wattle), that are intermediate in appearance will make identification more difficult.

It is not naturalised in Tasmania at present but assessment has shown that Manchurian Wild Rice (Z. latifolia) and its annual relatives may have weed potential in Tasmanian wetlands, lakes and river banks. Declaration therefore assists preventative management of this plant by prohibiting its trade and requiring eradication of all occurrences (Tasmania Department of Primary Industries and Water 2008).\n\nNative ecosystems: Z. latifolia, called Manchurian Wild Rice in New Zealand, is a serious weed of freshwater aquatic ecosystems in that country (New Zealand Plant Conservation Network 2005). Dense growth of Manchurian Wild Rice blocks waterways, impedes drainage causing flooding and disrupts recreational activities. It out-competes native water species destroying habitat for aquatic flora and fauna. It invades pasture, causing land to become waterlogged. The rhizomes penetrate and break up water banks (Auckland Regional Council 2007; Environment Walkato 2002–2007).\n\nZizania latifolia is also cultivated in Asia for its succulent stems and is available in parts of North America as an ornamental plant (Duke 1983; Terrell 2007). In North America, it is considered a serious threat to the native American Zizania species, as Z. latifolia is infected with the fungus Ustilago esculenta which causes swelling of the edible parts of the plant, the rhizomes and basal parts of the culms. The infection also prevents the plants from flowering and fruiting. If this fungus spread to the native species, it could have a devastating effect (Terrell 2007).\n\nNorthern Wild Rice (Z. palustris) is cultivated as a crop in some areas of the United States of America, with California being the largest producer (Terrell 2007).\n\nNorthern Wild Rice (Z. palustris) is grown as a gourmet food crop in New South Wales. Studies of this grain have shown that wild rice is rich in niacin, thiamine and riboflavin. It contains more high quality protein and lower fat content than wheat (Australian Speciality Rices undated).",

Southern Wild Rice and Northern Wild Rice, both annuals, are important constituents of aquatic plant communities in North America, providing food and shelter for numerous animal species. Southern Wild Rice is native from the central plains to the eastern seaboard of North America. Northern Wild Rice grows mostly to the north of Southern Wild Rice, but the two species overlap in the Great Lakes region, eastern Canada, and New England. Texas Wild Rice (Z. texana), a perennial, is listed federally as an endangered species in the United States of America. It grows only in the headwaters of the San Marcos River, in San Marcos, Texas (Terrell 2007).",

Following an assessment process, Arum Lily was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. It is a weed of agriculture, and is increasingly being recognised as a significant environmental weed, especially of damp and riparian areas, and of degraded seasonal wet natural  and urban areas, especially in peri-urban areas along creek lines, drains and seasonal damp areas. Found in gardens, sometimes originally planted. Dense infestations can completely eliminate pasture species or displace native species in bushland.  Infestations are generally confined to areas along rivers, creeks or swampy sites. Arum lily forms dense stands that may displace all species within the understorey layer. These infestations can block the flow of small streams, creaks and drains. Arum Lily is a problem for agriculture where it competes with pasture and is a health hazard for stock, being especially toxic to cattle. It is also poisonous to pets, and humans causing eczema and irritant dermatitis and is especially toxic to children causing fatalities.\n\nAgriculture: Arum Lily can form large spreading clumps. It is a problem for agriculture where it competes with pasture – dense infestations can completely replace pasture species (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) – and is a health hazard for stock, being especially toxic to cattle (Groves et al. 2005). The tuber-like roots and rhizomes, leaves, flowers (especially the yellow spike), fruit and seeds are poisonous, as well as being a skin and eye irritant to humans, livestock and pets (Shepherd 2004; Lloyd & Dodd 2006; Richardson et al. 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: However, it is increasingly being recognised as a significant environmental weed, which invades native vegetation and achieves dominance along watercourses and swampy habitats (Scott & Wykes 1997a). Dense clumps of Arum Lily crowd out native species affecting the biodiversity of natural areas, especially by replacing the native understorey. In wet, swampy habitats it can be extremely troublesome as it impedes water flow (Hussey et al. 1997).\n\nUrban areas: A weed in urban gardens, seasonal damp urban areas and abandoned sites, creek lines and drains, and disturbed areas such as roadsides.  The tuber-like roots and rhizomes, leaves, flowers (especially the yellow spike), fruit and seeds are poisonous, as well as being a skin and eye irritant to humans, livestock and pets (Shepherd 2004; Lloyd & Dodd 2006; Richardson et al. 2006).  Arum lily can also be toxic to dogs, cats and birds. If you think you have affected animals contact your vet. In humans causes eczema and irritant dermatitis (Shepherd 2004). The plant has caused fatalities in humans and stock and is especially toxic to children (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty & Associates 2003). Symptoms of poisoning include swelling and burning of the lips, mouth, throat and tongue, acute gastritis (stomach pain) and diarrhoea, causing exhaustion, shock and death (Lamp & Collet 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Shepherd 2004; Lloyd & Dodd 2006). Toxicity is due to calcium oxalate and the alkaloid coniine (Shepherd 2004). Further information on poison properties and poisoning is provided by Aplin (1966), Everist (1964, 1974), Covacevich et al. (1987), the Child Accident Prevention Foundation of Australia and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration Poisonous Plant Database.\n\nIf poisoning occurs and:\n\nthe patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nthe patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",

Following an assessment process, Bathurst Burr was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. It is a significant weed of agriculture and occurs in roadsides, water courses, waste areas, and rangelands\n\nAgriculture: Bathurst burr is mainly a pasture and rangeland weed, but also a weed of summer crops and horticultural crops. In the rangelands it is common in sandy creek lines and areas that flood. It is also found in summer growing crops such as soya bean and maize, and can be a significant weed of crops such as cotton, peas, potatoes, sugarcane and grapes. Burrs are an important cause of vegetable contamination of wool in wool growing areas, making fleeces harder to work with and reducing their value and causing problems for shearers. Seedlings are poisonous specially the cotyledons (seed leaves) to livestock, particularly horses and pigs, however older plants are not eaten. It is not such a major weed in the higher rainfall areas as it is a poor competitor, establishing mainly in bare disturbed sites, after floods or on fallows. It does not tolerate dense competition from other weeds or dense pasture. It has been widespread in the more marginal pasture areas for over a century (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Bathurst Burr also invades lowland grassland and grassy woodland, riparian vegetation, freshwater wetland, and rock outcrop vegetation (Carr et al. 1992). Dense populations could have a major impact on herbs and grasses in native vegetation (DPI 2007).\n\nUrban areas: Invades roadsides, watercourses and waste areas (DPIW 2007).

Anisworth (2004) did not consider Blue Periwinkle a problem in areas where sheep or cattle regularly grazed but observed that it is a common weed in horse paddocks. Although the leaves of Blue Periwinkle contain toxins, it was not a frequent cause of poisoning (Ainsworth 2004).\n\nNative ecosystems: Blue Periwinkle is a serious environmental weed in the temperate higher rainfall regions of southern Australia. It has escaped from cultivation and is invading native vegetation where it forms a dense mats covering and excluding other plants. It competes with native plants for moisture, light, nutrients. Its growth is particularly vigorous in riparian and moist habitats (CRC 2008).\n\nIn Victoria it is regarded as one of the top eight weeds of concern to public land managers (Williamson 1991 in Twyford & Baxter 1999). Blue Periwinkle is capable of forming a dense ground cover that suppresses native species and prevents tree and shrub regeneration (Thorp & Wilson 2008). Blue Periwinkle has also invaded temperate rainforest and identified as a threat to endangered and vulnerable plant species. A dense canopy of periwinkle can also alter fauna habit (CRC 2008). It has become a problem in various ecosystems, found primarily in damp and seasonally moist sites in forest, woodlands and heathlands, as well as along waterways and drainage lines (Muyt 2001). Blue periwinkle invades dry coastal vegetation, heathland and healthy woodland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, damp sclerophyll forest, riparian vegetation, and warm temperate rainforest (Carr et al 1992).\n\nUrban areas: Known as a weed in neglected and abandoned areas where its spreads vegetatively.",

    "impact": "Great Mullein is capable of spreading very quickly and rosettes covering a large area.\n\nAgriculture: Great Mullein is generally not grazed and its survival is favoured by the removal of competitive species. It can therefore replace a considerable amount of pasture, potentially reducing carrying capacity (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Victorian Resources Online 2007). This plant is poisonous to stock, but the risk of this occurring is minimal as the animals do not tend to feed on it as the dense hairs on the plant irritate the skin and mouths of stock. Studies of Great Mullein have reported the production of anti-germination and root-growth inhibiting compounds that affect the seeds of Barley (Hordeum vulgare). This is not thought to be of any significance in Australia as Great Mullein is not a weed of cereal crops (Pardo et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Great Mullein can invade undisturbed ecosystems, generally open habitats such as grasslands, and therefore has the potential to displace native herb and grass species. High density populations have the potential to significantly alter plant community structure (Victoria Resources Online 2007). While not known to cause major problems of this sort in Australia, in other areas (e.g. North America) Great Mullein adapts easily to a wide variety of natural habitats, grows vigorously to out-compete native species, and can threaten the regeneration of degraded native areas (Remaley 1998; Starr et al. 2003).",

    "impact": "Prickly Acacia is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nAgriculture: Prickly Acacia could potentially infest vast tracts of grasslands and woodlands throughout Australia. The economic impacts of Prickly Acacia on Queensland’s grazing industry are estimated at $5 million per year. Even at medium densities, it halves the primary productivity of grasslands, interferes with stock mustering and restricts stock access to water. Control costs considerably outweigh its benefits as a shade tree and drought fodder (CRC 2003).\n\nNative ecosystems: Prickly Acacia dramatically alters the ecological balance of grasslands and thereby threatens biodiversity, particularly in the Mitchell Grass Downs in Queensland, home to 25 rare and threatened animal species and two endangered plant communities. Even a moderate canopy cover of Prickly Acacia reduces grass cover markedly and changes the relative abundance of native plant species in favour of forbs and annual grasses, in turn affecting the native fauna and overall ecology of the system. Infestations also have an impact on tourism and land use by indigenous people (Mackey 1998; CRC 2003).\n\nSee Victorian Resources Online (at http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/impact_prickly_acacia ) for a more detailed impact assessment.",

    "impact": "Karroo Thorn is on the Alert List for Environmental Weeds, a list of 28 non-native plants that threaten biodiversity and cause other environmental damage. Although only in the early stages of establishment, these weeds have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: Karroo Thorn has considerable potential to become a troublesome weed. It is a known invader of established vegetation over a wide climatic range. It has a persistent seedbank and is fire resistant, fast growing and protected from browsing by its thorns. It is weedy in South Africa, where it grows in similar habitat and climate to that found in native grasslands from central New South Wales to southern Queensland. Losses to agriculture in these areas would be significant as the dense, thorny thickets it forms suppress the growth of grasses, prevent stock movement and restrict watering, adding to the costs of mustering (CRC 2003).",
    "controlMethods": "NO",
    "origin": "In southern Africa Karroo Thorn is the most widespread Acacia. It is very adaptable, growing under many different soil, climate and altitude conditions. Its limiting factors appear to be intense cold and lack of moisture. Eastern Cape Province (with 400-900 mm annual rainfall) is the area mainly affected by infestations of Karroo Thorn, where it forms a major part of the vegetation and has invaded grasslands and large areas of rangelands. Plant densities of 1000–2000 trees/ha have been recorded. In Natal (with 750–900 mm annual rainfall) Karroo Thorn forms part of the coastal dune forest. It is common in the watercourses of the Karroo region of central Cape Province. It is also present in southern Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. In the early days of colonisation in southern Africa, Karroo Thorn was used for fuel, fodder and shade, and for the construction of wheels, poles and rural implements. The thorny branches were also used for protection against wild animals (CRC 2003).",

In some places it can form pure stands, replacing native vegetation (Hannan-Jones & Csurhes 2012). Para Grass can change fuel characteristics in floodplains, when it replaces native grasses. More or more severe fires can in turn further displace native grasses such as Hymenachne acutigluma and damage or kill trees and thus reduce forest cover (Douglas and O’Connor 2004).\n\nWhen growing along streams, Para Grass can also slow down the water flow, leading to increased sedimentation (Bunn et al. 1998). Terrestrial invertebrates are reduced in abundance and diversity in Para Grass stands compared to stands of the native grass Hymenachne acutigluma (Douglas & O’Connor 2003a). Dense Para Grass stands can also have a detrimental effect on wetland bird populations, but does not appear to impact aquatic invertebrates (Douglas & O’Connor 2003b; G.

    "impact": "Gorse (Ulex europaeus) is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. it is an invasive spiny shrub that forms dense impenetrable thickets (DPI NSW 2019)  excluding desirable species,  domestic & native animals, and people, and can provide cover for feral animals such as rabbits or foxes, altering fire regimes because of retention of dry branches and spiny leaves and the base of the plant..\n\nAgriculture: Gorse is a major agricultural weed in Tasmania and parts of Victoria and a weed in other areas of southern Australia. It reduces pasture carrying capacity and has rendered many hectares of land useless for grazing (DPIW 2002; CRC 2003), blocking access to land. It readily invades native, semi-improved, improved pastures, neglected cropping lands, and neglected hobby farms. Gorse also infests forestry areas, interfering with tree establishment, competes with tree seedlings, restricts operational access, imposes costs for control, and is also a fire hazard.\n\nNative ecosystems: Gorse is increasingly becoming a threat as an environmental weed in many national parks and other bushland areas. Gorse forms monocultures in native habitats, reducing diversity and impacting on native animals, and also alters fire regimes and intensity. Gorse readily establishes in riparian zones, wet and dry forest, healthy woodland, open grassy woodland to grasslands, heathland, and coastal vegetation.\n\nUrban areas: Invades roadside and railway reserves and spreads along these corridors replacing vegetation.",

    "impact": "As a natural part of Australian wetlands, stands of Cumbungi provide cover, food nesting places for water birds and other native animals as well as habitats for aquatic insects, native fishes, freshwater invertebrates (yabbies etc.) and frogs. The plant protects the sides of creeks, lakes and ponds from erosion. The prolific growth provides natural mulch for adjoining foreshores (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated). Indigenous Australians used Cumbungi as a source of fibre and young rhizomes were eaten (Briggs 1987).\n\nNative ecosystems: Cumbungi is a successful competitor in aquatic sites. Its tall, dense spring growth dominates the canopy during summer and early autumn and bulky rhizomes occupy most of the space available in the substrate (Finlayson et al. 1995). A study based on a series of aerial photographs of Lake Forrestdale just south of Perth illustrates how quickly Cumbungi can spread once established at a site. The photos revealed that prior to 1964, no T. orientalis occurred at the lake with the first stand appearing in 1967. By 1976, a fairly large stand had established on the southern end of the lake and by 1984 it had colonised almost the entire 6 km of lake margin. In the process, dense stands of T. orientalis had displaced the native sedges and rushes in the understorey of the Melaleuca woodland fringing the lake (Brown & Brooks 2002).\n\nAgriculture: Cumbungi has become a problem in Australian irrigation areas. It can rapidly spread throughout a dam or irrigation channel, restricting the water flow, increasing the rate of siltation and by altering the water flow, increasing the risk of flooding and erosion (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated). The problem has become more serious since the advent of continuous rice cropping in the Ord River region, the Burdekin River, the Murrumbidgee, Coleambally and the Murray River Valleys (Finlayson et al. 1995). Over a period of time it can greatly decrease the amount of water being stored in farm dams and increase the amount of maintenance necessary (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated).\n\nUrban areas: Cumbungi has recently established itself along roadsides in table drains that do not have permanent water. This has led to an increase in the amount and cost of routine maintenance of these drains. Also, because of the large amounts of organic matter produced, Cumbungi can cause problems with water pollution when the leaves die off and start to decompose (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy undated).\n\nIn New Zealand, T. latifolia (Giant Reedmace) forms dense thickets, displacing native vegetation. It is thought that it could potentially hybridise with the native T. orientalis (Raupo) (Auckland Regional Council 2008).",

    "impact": "Caltrop (Tribulus terrestris) impacts agriculture and people by growing over and out-competing other plants, and causing injury and damage to people and animals via the large numbers of spiny fruits (nutlets) that each plant produces. A single plant forms a mat-like cover over a relatively large area and may even discourage the growth of other plants through allelopathic (inhibitory) effects (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Spines of caltrop cause injury to fruit pickers, shearers and people around farm buildings, roadsides and recreational areas.\n\nAgriculture: It has become a weed of cultivated crops, orchards, over-grazed pastures, stock yards, roadsides and neglected areas, particularly in areas with high summer temperatures and dry sandy soils where there is little competition. The spiny fruits (nutlets) can injure animals feet of horses, sheep, cattle and dogs. Caltrop foliage is toxic to livestock, especially sheep. Grazing of Caltrop has been associated with nitrate poisoning, photo-sensitisation and sheep staggers (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Naughton & Bourke 2005).  If fruits are eaten by livestock it can damage the mouth and possibly the lining of the stomach and intestines. If they are growing in orchards, vineyards and market gardens they can both be an annoyance to pickers and can contaminate the harvest, particularly cereal or dried-fruit crops. Nutlets may also become embedded in sheep fleeces, lowering their value (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The plant can cause some agricultural loss and its presence may affect land value.\n\nNative ecosystems: Mostly grows in disturbed sites and open areas with little impact on intact native vegetation.  However, it can grow on the edge native vegetation, on the edge of tracks, sometimes in degraded grasslands and open vegetation, nature roadside verges and nature strips.\n\nUrban areas:  It occurs in railway yards, nature strips, parks, and waste areas towns and cities and grows in crack in pavers and car parks in urban areas. Prefers dry sandy soils where there is little competition and will from dense mono-cultures replacing most grasses or ground covers. The spiny fruits (nutlets) can injure people  easily penetrate human flesh, especially those with no shoe on.  Spiny fruits can pierce thin shoe soles, puncture bicycle tyres, and injure domestic animals, normally dogs. They are a particular nuisance to humans on playing fields and caravan parks.",

It may have originated in the Saharan region, and spread into the Mediterranean region (Squires 1979, cited in Guertin, 2005). However only global DNA studies are likely to be able to suggest where it might have originally been native (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",

It forms dense mats up to 60 cm deep with stems up to 4 m long (Blood 2001). It also smothers native vegetation and prevents regeneration of all plants. It completely dominates the ground layer, preventing the germination of shrub and tree species (Muyt 2001). Research in New Zealand found that a dramatic decrease in species richness and abundance of native seedlings could be attributed to an increase in Wandering Trad biomass and a consequent decrease in light availability (Standish et al. 2001). The plant prevents regeneration of trees and shrubs, increases litter decomposition, altering nutrient cycling and inhibit germination of native species.  Can be found growing in the understory of disturbed forests, along roadsides, riparian areas and coastal forests. They are also common on old home sites and once established have the potential to grow forming a dense ground cover or “bed” in the understory (Brisbane City Council 2021).\n\nHuman and agriculture impacts: Wandering Trad causes allergic reactions on the skin of humans and especially dogs, and has been reported as toxic to cattle (Blood 2001). Mats growing on riverbanks can break away with water flow and contribute to flooding.",

With similar climate and soils to South Africa, Australia needs to be concerned with the potential of the tree to become more widespread. It can tolerate saline soils, is tolerant of frost once it is established, with temperatures down to -4 oC being no problem. These trees cope with drought and are adaptable to different seasons. Its ability to spread rapidly into woodlands, firebreaks, tracks, roadsides and other open areas has the potential to affect fire regimes and natural ecosystems. This species has aggressive roots which make it problematic for urban plantings. For example, the concentrated presence of Rosewood plants along a watercourse in Queensland has caused problems by clogging drains with their roots, leaves and seeds, resulting in flooding (CRC 2003; Gardening Australia 2007).",

    "impact": "Grader Grass was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Grader Grass was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: Younger plants are readily eaten by livestock, but flowering plants are unpalatable and rarely grazed. Because of its short period of usefulness, and propensity to out-compete more useful grasses, Grader Grass can seriously reduce the productivity of pastures in the tropical and semi-arid regions of northern Australia. It is also an important weed of crops in many parts of northern Australia, and is particularly troublesome in sugar cane (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is regarded as a major crop weed in coastal northern and central Queensland, and a minor crop weed in inland central Queensland and the Northern Territory (Wilson et al. 1995). Grader Grass is also a very common weed of roadsides, where it can quickly become a safety hazard by reducing visibility on corners (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Grader Grass can also significantly reduce the biodiversity of native grasslands, savanna woodlands and rangelands, particularly in areas that are overgrazed or disturbed (Smith 2002). It replaces native plants and forms tall thickets that can cover large tracts of land. Due to its greater biomass than the native plants it replaces, and hence its higher fuel loads, Grader Grass alters the fire regime. It does this by carrying more wildfires that are of a much greater intensity than the native plants are used to. Each of these hot fires, during the late dry season, cause a thinning of the native woodlands and eventually the number of trees in the ecosystem are reduced, resulting in a change from native savanna woodlands to exotic grasslands (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nFor these reasons Grader Grass is also seen as an important environmental weed in northern and eastern Australia. It is currently causing most concern in the semi-arid rangelands of northern Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it is abundant and continuing to spread. However, it also appears in the list of the top 200 most invasive plants of south-eastern Queensland, is in the New South Wales North Coast environmental weed list, and was recently listed as a priority environmental weed in two Natural Resource Management regions. It is also seen as a potentially significant threat to the Kimberley region in northern Western Australia, though it is not yet very widespread in this region (Batianoff & Butler 2002; Navie & Adkins 2007).",

It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. It increases surface soil salinity changing ecosystems, shades and competes with desirable species.\n\nAgriculture: Athel Pine impacts the pastoral industry by increasing the difficulty of mustering, and decreasing pasture production. It contributes to the drying up of waterholes, thus reducing the number of watering points, increasing management pressures and reducing carrying capacity (ARMCANZ 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Athel Pine displaces Eucalyptus species and other native vegetation, resulting in dominance of the ground vegetation by relatively few species of introduced or salt-tolerant plants, and a reduction in the number of birds and reptiles (Fuller 1998) and invertebrates (Gouldthorpe 2008). The replacement of native vegetation with Athel Pine may also alter the fire regime as it does not burn well and hence suppresses the natural tendency of fire to provide a trigger for regeneration of native species. Athel Pine excretes salt through its leaves which leads to higher salinity levels in the dense compacted litter. It does not form nesting hollows so nesting sites are lost when Athel Pine displaces native vegetation (ARMCANZ 2001).\n\nAthel Pine is drought resistant and varies its water use dependent on availability. It is responsible for lowering water tables, and thus draining waterholes and depriving native flora of water (Fuller 1998). Dense Athel Pine infestations increases sedimentation rates by trapping and stabilising sediment during river flows. This can cause increased overland flooding and erosion (ARMCANZ 2001).\n\nAthel Pine also impacts the tourist industry by reducing the aesthetic value of rivers and creeks in Central Australia (ARMCANZ 2001).\n\nUrban areas: Accelerates rusting of roofs, gutters, fences water mains, building overhung by Athel Pine.",

They can infest a wide range of grass crops including maize, millet, rice, sorghum, and sugarcane, as well as some broadleaf plant crops, e.g., sunflower and tomatoes (Smith 2002).\n\nWitchweed infestation can be a consequence of monocropping (growing the same crop year after year) with cereals causing declining soil fertility which can weaken the host plants resistance to parasitism. As a result of these cropping practices, Witchweed species have developed high numbers of long-lived seeds in the soil bank, with only some breaking dormancy each season (CIMMYT 2004).\n\nThe symptoms of parasitism by Witchweed species can be difficult to distinguish from those caused by drought, such as wilting, curling of leaves, stunted growth and a pronounced 'burnt' appearance to leaf edges. Witchweed infestations can significantly reduce yields (OISAT 2004).",

Following an assessment process, the Giant Rat's Tail grasses were not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, they remain weeds of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: The Giant Rat's Tail grasses are serious weeds of pastures in the coastal districts of Queensland and northern New South Wales. They are of low palatability and can greatly reduce the productivity of agricultural land by completely displacing desirable pasture species. This reduction in productivity can be exhibited in reduced stocking capacities, longer periods of time to record adequate weight gains in beef cattle, and higher costs in milk production on dairy farms. For example, the cost of producing milk on two dairy properties in the Rosedale/Miriam Vale area in Queensland was increased by 15 to 25% by Giant Rat's Tail grass infestations. The economic costs incurred in managing these species with herbicides are also quite high, and heavily infested areas have reduced land values (Walton 2001). Mature leaf blades and stems are tough for animals to graze, and have been known to loosen the teeth of cattle and horses (Land Protection 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: The Giant Rat's Tail grasses are also significant environmental weeds in eastern Australia. They invade native grasslands, open woodlands, conservation reserves and wetland areas. When fully established in an area they can form a grass monoculture, excluding native plants and reducing biodiversity of native ground cover species. This can also have an impact on native herbivores, which find the plants unpalatable (Walton 2001).\n\nThe Giant Rat's Tail grasses are among the exotic perennial grass species invading native plant communities in New South Wales that have been listed as a \"key threatening process\". Together, they are also ranked among the top 25 environmental weeds in south-eastern Queensland (Batianoff & Butler 2002) and are also thought to pose a significant threat to rangeland biodiversity in central and northern Queensland. The Giant Rat's Tail grasses are already of concern in several conservation areas in Queensland and heavy infestations may also increase fire intensity in sensitive environmental areas (Walton 2001).",

Following an assessment process, Giant Parrametta Grass was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.Giant Parramatta Grass is a vigorous, persistent and invasive grass that is well adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions.\n\nAgriculture: It is a particularly serious problem in pastures in the wetter areas on the north coast of New South Wales. It is of low palatability and reduces the productivity of agricultural land by completely displacing desirable pasture species. The productivity and carrying capacity of invaded pastures can be significantly reduced, and farmers have reported losses in carrying capacity ranging from 10–80% depending on the density of the infestation. Cattle grazing in pastures infested with Giant Parramatta Grass also take significantly longer to reach equivalent weights to those grazing in uninfested pastures and the tough, fibrous nature of the stems can also increase teeth wear in livestock (Walton 2001; Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nThe economic costs incurred in managing this species are also quite high and heavily infested areas have reduced land values. Giant Parramatta Grass can have other less obvious impacts, such as causing damage to asphalt on roadsides and tracks and decreasing the aesthetic appeal of infested areas. Large infestations may also affect fire intensity and/or frequency, particularly in winter and spring (Walton 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Giant Parramatta Grass is also regarded as a significant environmental weed in New South Wales and Queensland. It invades native grasslands, open woodlands, conservation reserves and wetland areas and when fully established it excludes native plants. Giant Parramatta Grass is one of the exotic perennial grass species invading native plant communities in New South Wales that have been listed as a \"key threatening process\" (Navie & Adkins 2007). It is also ranked among the top 50 environmental weeds in south-eastern Queensland (Batianoff & Butler 2002) and is thought to pose a significant threat to rangeland biodiversity in central and northern Queensland.",

    "impact": "Spanish Broom (Spartium junceum) is commonly grown as a garden ornamental, particularly in the cooler parts of Australia. It has escaped cultivation and is regarded as a minor environmental weed. Spanish Broom is able to fix nitrogen and can increase the nitrogen content of the soil at the sites where it invades and facilitate the invasion of other weeds (Zouhar 2005; Southern Tablelands and South Coast Noxious Plants Committee undated). Broom species primarily threaten natural habitats such as conservation areas at present, although they may also compete with favourable species in pastures. Spanish broom can dominate disturbed areas where it can out-compete native plants and alter soil nutrients (DPI NSW 2019)\n\nAgriculture: To date, limited impact in primary production areas, with potential to invade poorly managed pastures and hobby farms if left unchecked.\n\nNative ecosystems: Native flora and fauna are threatened when native plants are out-competed and natural habitat is replaced by infestations of Broom species. Broom species may also harbour rabbits. These weed species are able to invade seemingly undisturbed bushland and therefore represent a significant threat to ecological values (Regional Weeds Advisory Committee 2002; Southern Tablelands and South Coast Noxious Plants Committee undated). In Victoria, Spanish Broom invades lowland grassland, grassy woodland and rock outcrop vegetation, and it is listed as being a 'potential threat to one or more vegetation formations' (Carr et al. 1992). Although currently Spanish Broom is relatively sparingly naturalised in Australia, there is potential for the species to become a more serious weed in the future, as it has in California (Zouhar 2005).\n\nUrban areas: Occasionally persistent and  spreads in abandoned gardens in to roadside, and little managed urban areas. The seeds and leaves of Spanish Broom, if eaten in large quantities, are very poisonous, especially to children. They contain the toxin quinolizidine alkaloid cytosine and sparteine (Shepherd 2004). Spanish broom is toxic to humans a but is not considered life-threatening. Symptoms when ingested include, causing nausea, diarrhea, convulsions and respiratory distress.\n\nWhat to do if poisoning occurs:\n\nIf the patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nIf the patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",

Following an assessment process, Common Cord-grass was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nNative ecosystems: Common Cord-grass invasion has resulted in the alteration of coastal environments – transforming saltmarsh and mangrove communities and sandy beaches into 'Spartina meadows' (Muyt 2001; Walsh 2007, pers. comm.). The effects on biota in these habitats is largely unknown in Australia, but there is evidence that wader-bird use of areas previously free of Common Cord-grass declines significantly following invasion by the grass (Simpson 1996).\n\nBased largely on non-Australian studies, one effect is believed to be as a direct consequence of change of structure of the community, from a low-open herbland/shrubland, to relatively tall, dense grassland. The availability of food species such as small crustaceans and molluscs is almost certainly affected too, further rendering habitats unsuitable for fauna that depend on these (Lee & Choy 2004).\n\nHuman impacts: Social impacts include rendering boating and boat launching facilities inoperable due to accretion of sediments by Common Cord-grass plants (Walsh 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nAgriculture: Common Cord-grass infestations can also affect oyster farming in the intertidal areas and change hydrodynamics (Kriwoken & Hedge 2000).",

The hybrid arose in Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, and on the northern coast of France as a result of the introduction of S. alterniflora into areas where S. maritima was naturally occurring. The hybrid, later described as S. × townsendii, was first noticed in 1870. It was male-sterile (i.e., its anthers contained no fertile pollen), but readily spread by vegetative growth.\n\nIn 1892, it was observed that the sterile hybrid had 'overcome' its sterility through a duplication of chromosomes (a phenomenon known as 'amphipolyploidy'), and was now a sexually reproducing species (Hubbard 1968) and was later named Spartina anglica. Its ability to 'reclaim' mudflats through the accumulation of silt and other debris was soon acknowledged and it became used widely on shallow shores to increase the amount of useable ground (e.g., for pasture) (Hubbard 1968).",

    "impact": "Agriculture: Johnson Grass is considered to be one of the ten worst weeds in the world (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Washington State NWCB Undated). It causes severe crop losses due to direct competition, chemical inhibition of the growth of other plants and by acting as a host to crop pests and diseases (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001) It readily invades arable land, especially in areas of high summer rainfall, and has seriously reduced crop yields in New South Wales and Queensland (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is also a host for the Sorghum Midge (Contarinia sorghicola), as well as the aphid-transmitted sugarcane mosaic virus which causes dwarf mosaic disease in Maize and Sorghum. It also provides a pollen contaminant of nearby cultivated Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) (Cotton Catchment Communities CRC 2007).\n\nJohnson Grass is potentially toxic to livestock. It provides useful forage but at certain developmental stages or under some adverse environmental conditions, Johnson Grass may form cyanogenetic glycosides that can poison livestock. The glycosides are present in sorghum at low levels most of the time. However, acute poisoning is most likely to occur when the plant is growing fast, such as when it rains after a dry spell, and in damp or overcast conditions, or when hungry animals eat a large amount of fresh moist grass. The glycoside when metabolised releases hydrogen cyanide into the blood stream. Cattle tend to be more susceptible than sheep (Hawkins & Lacey 2001; Howard 2004). Other reports state that Johnson Grass is most toxic to animals when it is under stress from frost, drought, when it has been sprayed with herbicide, or has been trampled, especially in young leaves and stems (Howard 2004; Cotton Catchment Communities CRC 2007). Johnson Grass may also sequester selenium (or other elements that are toxic at high doses) when growing in soils with high concentrations of toxic elements. In the Dead Sea area of Jordan, for example, selenium concentrations in Johnson Grass samples were high enough to poison livestock. Prolonged consumption of fresh Johnson Grass can cause nitrate poisoning in animals.\n\nNative ecosystems: South of 32°S in Australia, where rainfall is lower and more evenly spread, Johnson Grass is restricted to roadsides, fence lines, waste places and channel edges; however, it will invade native vegetation, particularly wetlands, from adjoining arable lands (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nUrban environments: Johnson Grass presents a safety hazard on roads by restricting visibility on curves and corners (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board Undated).",

    "impact": "In Australia, other alien Sow-thistle species, such as Milk Thistle (Sonchus oleraceus), are major weeds of cropping systems, especially in south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales, and the importance of Milk Thistle as a weed appears to be increasing (Widderick et al. 1999; Chauhan et al. 2006). Given the problems caused by other Sow-thistle species in Australia, and the weed history of the Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis) in North America, it is a potentially serious threat to agriculture in climatically suitable areas of Australia (Stajsic pers. comm. 2008).\n\nAgriculture: Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis) is a weed on arable land, and produces competitive plants particularly in annual, agricultural and horticultural crops in regularly cultivated fields. It can cause weed problems in any annual crop in temperate areas. (CABI 2020). Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis) is one of Russia's worst weeds. It infests all types of crops, and also occurs in fallows, vegetable and fruit gardens (Kravchenko 2006). In the United States of America and Canada, where it is naturalised, Perennial Sow-thistle is often an invader of cultivated areas, especially of small grain and row crops (McWilliams 2004; Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007). In Canada, it has been reported as the fifteenth most abundant weed in cereal and oilseed crops surveyed, where it occurred in 39% of rapeseed fields (Peschken et al. 1983). It causes economic loss by reducing crop yields, and increasing cultivation and herbicide expenses. It has reduced spring wheat yields by up to 45% in North Dakota (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007). Perennial Sow-thistle is a host of several important agricultural pests and diseases, such as the potato tuber rot nematode (Ditylenchus destructor) (Lemna & Messersmith 1990; Bond et al. 2007).\n\nNative ecosystems: Sow-thistles are also environmental weeds in Australia. Both the Milk Thistle and the Rough Sow-thistle (Sonchus asper) are considered to be serious environmental weeds in Victoria, where they have invaded at least 13 types of Victorian native vegetation (Carr et al. 1992). Perennial Sow-thistle is a potentially serious environmental weed in climatically suitable areas of Australia because it is long lived, spreads rapidly due to its creeping roots and has a broad ecological range (Stajsic pers. comm. 2008).\n\nUrban areas: Perennial Sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis)b is a weed of gardens in other parts of the world and could be come problematic in Australia, similar to other Sow-thistles spreading to roadsides, road reserves, neglected and abandoned areas.",

    "impact": "Silver-leaf Nightshade is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts on agriculture and primary production.  It is estimated that silverleaf nightshade probably causes losses to Australian agriculture of around $80M each year (Heap & Wu 2018).\n\nAgriculture: Silver-leaf Nightshade impacts crops and pastures reducing yields through competition for nutrients and water,  and is difficult to manages so reducing land values.  It can also exude plant growth inhibitors, interfere with animal husbandry and harvesting practices, and is an alternative host for plant eating insects and plant diseases and their vectors (Heap & Wu 2018).  It is actively spreading in the cereal areas of southern Australia and has the potential to spread much more widely. It significantly lowers crop yield (Lemerle & Leys 1991; Hawker 2004) in winter cereal-growing areas and also affects such crops as cotton, sorghum, maize and lucerne. The food reserves in its root system and the ability of the roots to grow deeper than those of most crops allow it to establish itself earlier than any crop it is competing with (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007), and because it is summer-growing it depletes nutrients for later sown winter crops. Silver-leaf Nightshade may support populations of pests harmful to other Solanaceous crops (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007) such as potatoes, capsicums, tomatoes and eggplants.\n\nSilver-leaf Nightshade may also have allelopathic effects in cotton (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The spiny leaves and stems contaminate hay made from infested paddocks (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007).\n\nFruits can be toxic to some livestock. Cattle are more likely to be affected than sheep while goats are not affected at all (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007). Hawker (2004) reports the successful use of sheep and goats for suppressing growing shoots, but stock was not introduced to paddocks where fruits were present on plants in that study.\n\nThe Australian cereal cropping zone hosts a range of valuable major enterprises that are at risk from Silver-leaf Nightshade, including production of cereals (e.g. wheat, barley, triticale, oats), pulses (e.g. peas, beans, lentils, lupins, vetch), oilseeds (e.g. canola), hay, grazing (e.g. sheep, cattle), and myriad minor enterprises. In addition, horticultural enterprises such as wine, vegetable and fruit production are at risk. (Heap & Wu 2018)\n\nNative ecosystems: Carr et al. (1992) suggests that it is not a weed of natural ecosystems, but this may be due to lack of opportunity to this time as recent observation indicate it can spread into and grow in open vegetation in semi-arid environments (Chris Brodie pers. com. 2020).\n\nUrban areas: Known to spread along roadsides and fire breaks and under power-lines, it is also a weed of grassy areas in towns and cities.  Spines on plants may induce an allergic reaction in some people (Botanical Dermatology Database 1994 -). Whether fruits are toxic to man appears not to be documented but American Indians of south-western parts of the United States have used the fruits for converting milk to cheese and they have also used them in tanning of hides (Boyd et al. 1984).",
    "controlMethods": "NO",
    "origin": "For many years it had been unclear whether Silver-leaf Nightshade originated in North America or South America but recent DNA studies have shown its relationships lie with other Mexican and southern USA species of Solanum and so this is likely to be its area of origin, with  and recent studies confirming that Silver-leaf Nightshade is probably native to the Monterrey region of north-eastern Mexico (Heap & Wu 2018). Early American colonists were presumably responsible for its spread outside this region into other areas of the Americas (Levin et al. 2006).  It is now a weed in may areas outside it native range.",

    "impact": "Variegated Thistle (Silybum marianum) is found on roadsides and in waste areas, in pastures and occasionally in crops. It is a highly competitive weed once it starts to establish and due to the size of its rosette and its ability to compete for light, nutrients and moisture it shades out other species. Establishment is favoured by bare ground or sparse pasture, consequently infestations often occur on stock camps, rabbit warrens and cultivated fire breaks. Variegated thistle has a high early growth rate, which allows it to out-compete many pasture seedlings (Government of South Australia 2021). When the thistle plants die in summer the ground is left bare and open for re-establishment of Variegated Thistle and other weeds in autumn. Variegated Thistle grows best in areas of high fertility and a weed of cultivated land, roadsides, neglected areas, generally replaces existing plants. In addition to its actual impacts, it also receives some attention because of its size and spiny, non-native appearance\n\nAgriculture: A highly competitive weed once it starts to establish in pastures. Due to the size of its rosette and its ability to compete for light, nutrients and moisture it shades out more desirable pasture species. Where established in areas cut for hay it will contaminate the fodder reducing its value and enabling further dispersal of the weed. Where Variegated Thistle can get established in natural plant communities it is also able to displace native species through its competitive ability (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Its prickly nature and its ability to form a dense sward make access and control using hand tools difficult, and can also deter stock and wildlife while harbouring vermin like rabbits. Variegated Thistle is often eaten by stock after being cut or sprayed, as are dead plants in summer. Stock will also eat the leafy green plants. However grazing of fresh green growth in winter can cause serious stock poisoning because of the high nitrate content of the foliage, especially on cloudy days in wet weather or when soil moisture is high. The spines on the leaves can damage the digestive tract of grazing animals (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992), especially of cattle (Government of South Australia 2021). Also grows in some cops and place such as sheep camps and stock-yards.\n\nNative ecosystems: Occasionally found in native grassy lands or open or degraded areas.  Can be found on the edge of and in roadside vegetation. Normally not found in dense healthy woodlands. During seed development the seed-heads are sought after by Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, Galahs and Crimson Rosellas as a food (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nUrban areas: Found on roadside and disturbed are like machinery yards and abandoned areas, little cared for grassy areas, and on the edge of creek lines.",

Common along parts of the coast on sand dunes and road sides.\n\nAgriculture: Bladder Campion can form dense patches that limit growth of crops. Before powerful machinery was common, its strong root system was an obstacle to ploughing fields. As it sheds its seed at around the same time as several pasture species, it is likely to contaminate seed harvested from the pasture (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Bladder Campion impacts on pasture production, although it can be grazed by livestock and is not known to be poisonous. It is an invader in uncompetitive pastures and crops, and also a nuisance in perennial horticulture where herbicides that destroy it cannot be used\n\nNative ecosystems:  On sandy coasts it competes with native herbaceous species and it has been reported as invasive in dry coastal vegetation. It is particularly common on some beaches of the southern Mornington Peninsula in Victoria (Carr et al. 1992; Walsh 2008).\n\nUrban areas: Can be a persistent weed in neglected and abandoned gardens, and spreading under (or over) fence lines.",

Seeds of Whorled Pigeon Grass are well adapted to dispersal by animals because of the retrorse barbs on the bristles of the inflorescences. The fruiting panicle attaches itself to the fur of passing animals by means of the retrorsely-barbed bristles and thereby achieves wide distribution of the seeds.\n\nAgriculture: Whorled Pigeon Grass is a potential seed contaminant (GRIN 2008) and a crop weed, especially of maize. As well as competing with a very wide range of tropical and temperate crops, it can cause difficulties during harvesting when the inflorescences become entangled with themselves and with the crop (CABI 2021). Not a problem in pastures as it is palatable.\n\nUrban environments: It is also a nuisance weed of gardens, roadsides, footpaths and wasteland (Edgar & Connor 2000).",

Following an assessment process, Sicklepod and Foetid Senna were not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, they remain weeds of potential national signficance.\n\nAgriculture: Sicklepod and Foetid Senna are aggressive invaders of pasture and can completely dominate grass species, eradicating pasture growth and excluding stock. Carrying capacities can be reduced by as much as 85%. It is conceivable that properties could become completely unproductive. Although it is generally unpalatable to stock, if eaten, Sicklepod is toxic to cattle. If left to grow in a sugar cane crop, Sicklepod can have a significant effect on yield. Processing contaminated cane can cause machinery breakdowns at sugar mills because of the woody nature of Sicklepod.\n\nNative ecosystems: Sicklepod is also causing concern as an environmental weed in some native ecosystems in Far North Queensland. Its current distribution suggests that it may be able to invade open native plant communities. Feral cattle, feral pigs and the occurrence of natural events such as cyclone, which open up the forest canopy, are likely to enhance the possibility of invasion into pristine areas and it is currently threatening small remnant areas of native grassland in the Wet Tropics. While there is no evidence that Sicklepod is currently an aggressive environmental weed in Australia, this may be because its impact is not yet evident. The information available suggests that its environmental impacts may increase in the future (Mackey et al. 1997).",

    "impact": "Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WoNS). Following an assessment process, Ragwort was not included as one of the 20 WoNS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. Ragwort is a serious agricultural and environmental weed. It is steadily invading pasture and native vegetation across southern Victoria.\n\nAgriculture: Ragwort contains alkaloid toxins that, if eaten by horses or any grazing animal, can have debilitating or fatal consequences. The highest concentration of toxin is found in the pollen, then in order, the leaves, stems and roots. The effect of the toxin is cumulative and irrevocable, and as it builds up in the body results in liver failure. The build up is undetectable until it finally reaches the critical level at which symptoms occur (DPIWE 2002; AgResource 2006). Dairy cattle forced to eat Ragwort produce tainted milk (McLaren & Faithfull 2004). In addition to its health impacts, Ragwort is a major pasture weed particularly on land grazed by cattle and horses and on dairy farms. Dairy cattle forced to graze ragwort produce tainted milk. It produces dense foliage close to the ground which suppresses and prevents regeneration of other vegetation. Ragwort competes strongly with more desirable plants, reducing pasture productivity and the value of agricultural land, and can be invasive in forestry plantations (Agriculture Victoria 2021). The ability of each Ragwort plant to produce tens of thousands of seeds, combined with its capacity to regenerate from root or crown fragments, gives Ragwort an amazing capacity to spread. Once established, Ragwort can overwhelm pasture and reduce its livestock carrying capacity (DPIWE 2002; AgResource 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems:  Ragwort can be invasive on roadsides, native forests and woodlands, threatening biodiversity in these areas.\n\nUrban areas: Ragwort can also be invasive on roadsides, and on urban fringes.",

It quickly colonizes bare overgrazed and drought effected pasture when rainfall occurs. (Everist et al. 1976). Light infestations can perform a useful function as a soil stabilizer acting as a trap for seed and other debris and protecting seedlings (Everist et al. 1976). Although the plant population increases rapidly after rain it slowly declines as it is affected by water stress. (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nAgriculture: It competes with useful pasture species and in dense infestations the spines may hinder the movement of stock (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Very heavy infestations of Galvanised Burr are reported to reduce stock-carrying capacity (Everist et al. 1976). Mature plants are not usually grazed because of the spines on the burrs along its stems (Auld 1981). However, seedlings and shoot tips can be a useful fodder in drought (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The burrs are a contaminant in wool, and an annoyance to sheep and wool handlers.  The burrs are not generally considered a major vegetable fault in the wool (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Not normally a problem in intact native vegetation. It becomes abundant in areas subjected to long-term drought after rains. It is symptomatic of overgrazing and degraded rangelands (Auld & Johnson 2011).\n\nUrban areas: Not known to be problematic in and around urban areas.",

    "impact": "Broad-leaf Pepper Tree was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Broad-leaf Pepper Tree was not included as one of the 20 WONS; however, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nBroad-leaf Pepper Tree is an aggressive pioneer species of wetland and riparian ecosystems. It has invaded many native vegetation communities in Australia, and poses a threat to species diversity in more intact ecosystems. Currently it is chiefly an environmental weed. It can rapidly colonise disturbed and undisturbed vegetation in wetland and riparian ecosystems, as well as coastal dunes, and may suppress re-establishment of native vegetation in the early successional stages of these ecosystems (Csurhes & Edwards 1998; Ensbey 2002). The shading effect and its allelopathic (inhibitory) properties can further prevent re-establishment of native vegetation (Gogue et al. 1974)\n\nIn Perth, Western Australia, it is becoming a major concern as an invader of coastal and near coastal wetlands, lakes and streams (Hussey et al. 1997; Keighery 2007, pers. comm.). At Thornlie it has invaded Eucalyptus rudis woodland along the Canning River foreshore, where it is a serious weed in that part of the river, and is often locally dominant (FloraBase 1998 -). At Blue Gum Lake it occurs in Eucalyptus rudis and Melaleuca rhaphiophylla woodland, and at the former delta of the Preston River at Bunbury it is naturalised on the edge of a Juncus kraussii marsh (FloraBase 1998 -). At Northampton it occurs along a creek in Acacia shrubland. It can also invade drier sites, and has been reported as naturalised in coastal heath at Rockingham.\n\nIn Queensland it is also generally an invader of mesic coastal or near coastal sites, but also occurs well inland. At Jacobs Well it occurs in Melaleuca quinquenervia woodland. At Ormiston it is invading mangroves, Melaleuca, Casuarina, Eucalyptus wetland forest at Boondall Wetlands Reserve, disturbed gallery, microphyll vine forest at Bundaberg, and at Degilbo it is invading Corymbia tessellaris, Eucalyptus crebra and E. tereticornis association on alluvium (National Herbarium of Victoria 2007). In northeast Queensland it is a riparian invader at Wild River at Hertberton. Broad-leaf Pepper Tree is considered to be one of the most invasive naturalised plants in south-eastern Queensland (Batianoff & Butler 2002).\n\nIn New South Wales the largest infestation occurs at Mullumbimby, where it has naturalised along the river and the roadside (Ensbey 2002). At Cape Byron it is invading Melaleuca–Eucalyptus lowland woodland, and at Hastings Point it occurs in beach scrub, in the hind dune areas among Banksia, Cupaniopsis, Alectryon, Acronychia, Schefflera community (National Herbarium of Victoria). It is also naturalised west of Moree. It is an 'alert weed' for the northern suburbs of Sydney (SydneyWeeds Committees 2007).\n\nDense stands can form around water holes and impede the access to water for stock, and interfere with mustering (Ensbey 2002). They also cast deep shade and prevent establishment of an herbaceous understorey (Cronk & Fuller 1995).\n\nIt is also an alternate host for mango black spot disease, and a host of witches broom disease in citrus (Ensbey 2002).\n\nBroad-leaf Pepper Tree is known to affect human and animal health as it contains toxic resins. Contact with the sap can cause persistent swelling, rashes, welts, running sores, swollen faces, colic and haemorrhages in the eyes. When flowering, the pollen can cause sneezing, asthma-like reactions and headache. The fruit if eaten is known to cause vomiting and diarrhoea (Queensland Poisons Information Centre 2007). Extensive bird deaths have also been reported in Florida from eating the fruit (Morton 1978). Horses that have been resting beneath the trees have developed dermatitis and swollen faces, similar to symptoms in humans (Ensbey 2002). Consumption by horses and cattle can cause haemorrhages, intestinal complication and fatal colic (Morton 1978). However, there are also reports of goats browsing on the foliage with no ill effects (Francis undated).",

It is regarded as one of the worst aquatic weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nRecreational activities: An infestation can cover the entire surface of a water body, reducing aesthetic values and preventing most recreational activities such as swimming, boating, water sports, and recreational fishing (Oosterhout 2006).\n\nAgriculture and fisheries: Commercial fisheries suffers dramatically with Salvinia plants blocking nets and impeding the passage of boats (Agriculture & Resource Management Council of Australia & New Zealand et al. 2003; CRC 2003). Dense mats of Salvinia can be mistaken for solid ground by people and animals with reported instances of animals falling into the water body beneath. The dense mats impede water flow, restrict stock access and provide favourable conditions for the breeding of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Salvinia can clog pump intakes and cause water losses from storage areas by increasing levels of evapo-transpiration (increased water evaporating from the plant leaves).\n\nNative ecosystems: Salvinia forms dense mats over the water surface, severely modifying aquatic habitat, shading out and creating unfavourable conditions for all aquatic organisms of flora and fauna, including birds, fish, invertebrates and other aquatic animals and aquatic plants. Light is excluded and oxygen levels are reduced leading to water stagnation and pollution. Decaying plant material can produce foul odours.",

It can invade pastures that have been stressed by overgrazing, frequent summer flooding or cultivation and replace valued pasture species. It may also compete with and reduce the yields of winter cereals, sorghum, maize and cotton. Although not usually a serious weed of wheat crops, its seed will still contaminate the wheat grain. Its seedlings are only weakly competitive and rarely invade vigorous established pastures. However, Mintweed does invade and compete very effectively with winter growing Phalaris aquatica pastures. Dry winters followed by wet summers provide optimal conditions for an explosive spread of the weed in disturbed pastures, where it can quickly take over. Rain also liberates allelopathic substances (chemical inhibitors) from minute bladder-like structures (glands) on the leaves, which have adverse effects on the germination and growth of seedlings of crop and pasture species (Cunningham et al. 1992; Felfoldi 1993; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nMintweed seed can contaminate pasture seed and is often found in seed of millet, sorghum, panic, lucerne, Vigna, Rhodes Grass, Phalaris, Buffel Grass, oats and Urochloa (Friend 1983).\n\nMintweed can be toxic to stock. It may be eaten by hungry stock and has been reported to have caused fatal nitrate poisoning in sheep and cattle. It is particularly a hazard when hungry animals are introduced for the first time to densely infested pastures or, in winter, when dried plant material has lost much of the strong odour and flavour that previously deterred grazing. There is a risk to animals when travelling along infested stock routes and contaminated cereal hay has caused poisoning (Hurst 1942; Everist 1974; Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977; Cunningham et al. 1992; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).

    "impact": "Most species of Willow are Weeds of National Significance. They are among the worst weeds in Australia because of their invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. They have invaded riverbanks and wetlands in temperate Australia, occupying thousands of kilometres of streams and numerous wetland areas (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: Willow thickets can restrict access to waterway impacting livestock.\n\nWater use: The amount of water willows use when located in the stream bed is substantially higher than native trees, which is damaging for water availability and water quality (CRC 2003). Field research in the Murray-Darling Basin has indicated that in cool temperate climates an average net water saving of 3.9ML a year could be achieved for each hectare of willow canopy removed, and in semi-arid climates this could be as high as an average of 5.5 ML (Doody and Benyon 2011).\n\nNative ecosystems: Willows spread their roots into the bed of a watercourse, slowing the flow of water and reducing aeration. Willows form thickets which divert water outside the main watercourse or channel, causing flooding, instability and erosion where the creek banks are vulnerable, as they can grow into water courses, changing ecosystems. As Willows are winter deciduous (all leaves fall from the tree for winter), the leaves fall into in water courses. This creates a flush of organic matter reducing water quality and available oxygen, directly threatening aquatic plants and animals. The replacement of native vegetation (e.g. river red gums) by willows reduces habitat (e.g. nesting hollows, snags) for both land and aquatic animals (CRC 2003). Willows have only invaded about 5% of their potential geographic range in temperate Australia (CRC 2003).\n\nUrban areas: Willows form dense impenetrable thickets and reduce or eliminate visual and physical access to water bodies. Willows form dense root mats and produce dense stems that block access for boats, canoes and rafts used for fishing and other aquatic activities. The spreading nature of Willows on waterways can also damage infrastructure.",

This is due to its proliferation in habitats that are similar, and close in proximity, to northern Australia (Waterhouse & Mitchell 1998).\n\nAgriculture: The spongy culms of Sacciolepis interrupta provide succulent fodder for buffalo and cattle (Lazarides 1980). The grain of S. interrupta is known to be collected and used as a food source in central Chad (Freedman 1998) and possibly in Nigeria, although it is unclear whether the grain used here is S. interrupta or S. africana (Burkhill 1985).\n\nS. interrupta is a common weed of rice-fields in Indonesia and Assam in India (Islam et al. 2004; Soerjani et al. 1987) and it is a major weed of transplanted lowland rice. With no control at all, weeds may reduce rice yields by 15–40% (Islam et al. 2004). In Indonesia, S. interrupta is a weed of deep water rice. These rice fields are under 60–120 cm of water for 6–7 months of the year (Soerjani et al. 1987).\n\nHuman impact: In India, S. interrupta growing in rice fields and fallow areas has been shown to be a host plant for the breeding of the three species of the mosquito Mansonia, which provide a vector for the round worm, Brugia malayi (Krishnamoorthy et al. 2007). This parasite causes serious disease in humans (Filarial Biology and Pathology undated).",

    "impact": "European Blackberries (Rubus fruticosus aggregate) is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts in cool to warm temperate to sub-tropical areas. European Blackberries can infest large areas quickly as they are vigorous growing plants with many plants able to germinate and vegetatively root covering larges areas. European Blackberries currently  infests about 9 million hectares of land in Australia. Thickets can pose a fire hazard because of the dry material contained within them. Larger animals may become trapped in the prickly thickets while smaller animals, native and feral rabbits and foxes use these thickets as shelter, and it also provides food for introduced species such as starlings, blackbirds, and foxes that subsequently spread of the species new new areas. Control costs are high and a sustained effort is needed to attain success (CRC 2003).\n\nHowever on the positive side, Blackberry plants are also used for fruit and honey production.\n\nAgriculture: Does not effect well managed farmland, but can established in paddocks as it is generally unpalatable to most livestock, eventually taking over forming large impenetrable thickets, and blocks access to waterways. Can also form thickets in orchards and forestry that restrict movement of people and machinery, reducing productivity and increasing control costs.\n\nNative ecosystems:  Blackberry forms impenetrable prickly thickets and mounds that fill gullies and hillsides, smoother native shrub layers and ground vegetation, and prevents germination of trees and shrubs preventing succession. These thickets can also reduce the natural attraction of the bush as well as hindering recreational opportunities by preventing access to natural features.\n\nUrban areas: Urban areas may also be affected, with blackberry occupying abandoned land and colonising roadside vegetation. Due to the prickles it is avoided by people as tough prickles it can tear and damage clothes and skin alike.",
    "controlMethods": "YES. Various strains of the rust fungus (Phragmidium violaceum) have been released across Australia (Harvey,  et al 2023).\n\nhttps://biocollect.ala.org.au/biocontrolhub/project/index/ef09ff0d-2af2-4c58-bee7-3198d4f6db4f",
    "origin": "European Blackberry is a native of Europe where there are hundreds of microspecies recognised. Recent work (Evans et al. 2007) has matched Australian species with at least 15 European species but there is still further work needed to decide whether the Australian species have a similar genetic content to their European counterparts or whether they have evolved further in Australia (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).",

Sweet Briar can compete with neighbouring pasture plants, significantly reducing productivity. Young plants and suckers can be suppressed by rabbit and stock grazing but mature woody plants are highly unpalatable to stock and reduce the presence and productivity of desirable pasture species through competition. Its prickly nature can also restrict stock movement and access to water, and deter grazing close to clumps.

Heavy infestations typically occur in hilly or rocky areas near trees, creek banks, or fence lines (Clements et al. 2005). Commonly seen growing along native roadside corridors out-competing native plants.  Although the seedlings have a low survival rate, once established, plants may be highly competitive (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).

It is considered a threat to all cropping, all grazing and all horticulture in Australia. Based on the modelling, Creeping Yellowcress has the potential to invade more than 650 000 km2 of agricultural land, putting at risk millions of dollars in revenue (Cunningham et al. 2004; Cunningham et al. 2006; Tasmanian Land and Water Professionals undated).\n\nIt is contains hirsutin in its roots, which inhibits germination and growth of some crops (Yamane et al. 1992).\n\nIt is tolerant to both drought and immersion. It has been reported as being a troublesome and persistent weed of nurseries and other horticultural enterprises in Tasmania, where it can have significant impacts on productivity. In the Netherlands it is a common weed of ornamental bulb production areas, where it reduces bulb crop value and marketability as a contaminant of nursery stock. It is also considered a serious agricultural and horticultural weed in the United States where it infests orchards and nurseries (Tasmanian Land and Water Professionals undated).\n\nIn New Zealand's south island, it is locally common, in gardens, market gardens, cultivated and swampy land, riverbeds and damp pasture.

    "impact": "Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) can produce a large amount of root suckers to form quite dense thickets or copses that exclude native and other vegetation (DPI NSW (2019; Weiseler 2008). Black Locust has become a locally serious weed in Europe and in the united States of America outside of its natural range. In parts of Germany it has been responsible for the conversion of grassland into woodland (Thorp, J.R. & Wilson, M. 1998). Suckering dense clumps are all interconnected and further disturbance encourages further dense suckering.\n\nAgriculture: Suckering plants can invade open paddocks, reducing carrying capacity. In addition, all parts of the plant including the leaves, wood, roots, pods and seeds are toxic to stock (Blood 2001). Black Locust is also fatal to horses and in one case a woman gave her horses some Robinia pseudoacacia to graze on. Within two hours both horses were in distress, shaking, frothing at the mouth and in much pain. The vet was able to save one of the horses, with the older horse  put down after hours of agony. The owner was previously unaware that the plant was poisonous (Thomson 2007). Horses feeding on Robinia pseudoacacia bark died after 4 hours (Wink & Van Wyk, 2008)\n\nNative ecosystems:  In Victoria, it has invaded lowland grassland and grassy woodlands, as well as riparian vegetation (Carr et al. 1992). Will invade grassy open areas, and suckers can invade edge of open woodlands, and vegetation on roadsides .\n\nUrban areas:  Individual trees can grow without suckering long into maturity, and do not sucker. Suckering occurs when roots are disturbed, or the tree is cut down, then prolific suckering can occur.\n\nBlack locust is toxic to humans (Blood 2001) and can cause discomfort and irritation, but is reported as not life-threatening (DPI NSW 2019). All parts of the plant are poisonous, especially the pods, seeds, bark and leaves. It can cause dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions and drowsiness.\n\nWhat to do if poisoning occurs:\n\nIf the patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nIf the patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",

This can lead to the plant invading pastures especially those on alluvial soils and cause a significant loss of prime grazing land (Wilson 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992). Castor oil plant is poisonous to dogs and livestock including cattle, horses, pigs, sheep and poultry. Livestock rarely eat this weed due to the odour of the leaves. However, poisoning can occur if grain is contaminated with seeds. Symptoms are similar to human poisoning. It may take a few hours or days for symptoms to appear. Honey bees have been poisoned by castor oil plants (NSW 2019). The seeds of Castor Oil Plant are extremely poisonous to humans and livestock (Wilson 1989; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems: common also waterways in open areas and wherever there is disturbance. If left untreated, Castor Oil Plant will grow to form dense stands along river banks and can grow to large sizes, outcompeting with native plants.\n\nHuman poisonings: Castor oil plant contains a toxin called ricin. It is toxic to humans, capable of causing serious illness and death. Flowers, leaves and especially the seeds are poisonous. Eating castor oil plant causes, a burning sensation in the throat and mouth, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and bleeding, bleeding from the eye and mucous membranes, respiratory and cardiac distress and failure. Temporary blindness may occur if the sap gets into the eyes.

    "impact": "Creeping Knapweed (Rhaponticum repens) has an extensive, fast-growing root system enabling rapid spread, plant hardiness and the ability of dense patches of Creeping Knapweed to smother and exclude other species, thus making it a very competitive agricultural weed (Pritchard 1992; McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Prolonged contact with Creeping Knapweed may cause skin sensitisation and dermatitis in humans (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998).\n\nAgriculture: Creeping Knapweed spreads aggressively and can render agricultural land and rangeland useless in a relatively short space of time (van Rangelrooy 1993).  In Victoria, Creeping Knapweed is recognised as one of the most competitive of all weeds (Agriculture Victoria 2021). However, in South Australia it does not normally dominate pastures, spreading slowly within a paddock and taking up to 20 years to become dominant after its introduction (Government of South Australia 2021). Once dominant they can virtually exclude all other vegetation and reduce yield in dry land cropping by as much as 80 per cent. Initially a common weed of irrigated vines, fruit and other crops (e.g. along the Murray River from Swan Hill to Merbein), it has become a serious competitor of cereal crops and dryland pastures in north-western Victoria, e.g. in dryland cropping in the Swan Hill-Kerang area of the Victorian Mallee, where it can form dense patches to the virtual exclusion of other vegetation and reduce the yield of cereal crops by as much as 75% or more (Pritchard 1992; McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nDue to its root system which can extend to 5 metres deep, once established it relies on subsoil moisture and can live and dominate in lower winter-rainfall climates. It can take advantage of the lack of competition in summer fallows, as its rate of growth is proportional to light intensity. Due to its deeper and more efficient root system, in dry years a heavy infestations can kill the cereal crop by water stress (Government of South Australia 2021) and heavily infested paddocks are sometimes no longer able to be cropped (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nAs a major competitive weed of cereal crops, it can cause heavy yield losses and resulting economic impacts (Pritchard 1992). In summer its active growth can completely suppress the growth of other crops such as Sudan Grass and Sorghum (Kleinschmidt & Johnson 1977). It forms dense patches shading out crops and pastures, as well as being a vigorous and efficient competitor for water and nutrients (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Lloyd 2006). However, it's growth rate declines under shading and it does not compete well under a heavy canopy, and is weakened by dense shade (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nIt impacts on the productivity of pastures, and has little feed value. The leaves, although having a bitter disagreeable taste, are still grazed by sheep (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001), but may be poisonous and kill sheep if eaten in large amounts (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Lloyd 2006). Overseas claims of Creeping Knapweed being poisonous to livestock and causing a neurological disorder in horses (which can result in death by starvation) have not been reported in Australia (van Rangelrooy 1993; McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nIt has allelopathic properties (releases chemicals) that restrict growth of other species such as oats, beans and tomatoes, which might contribute to it occurring in almost pure Creeping Knapweed stands (McIlroy & Faithfull 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Seed is occasionally found in oats, linseed and canary seed (Friend 1983). The seeds are bitter and impart an unpleasant taste to flour made from contaminated grain (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Primarily an agricultural weed, grows on the edge of open or degraded, disturbed native vegetation.\n\nUrban areas: Mainly a weed of agriculture and disturbance e.g. by cultivation, erosion or earth movement, it may grow by roadsides and sheds and yards, abandoned areas where it may have been spread by machinery and vehicles.",

They may compete strongly in poorly managed areas, however they are rarely significant weeds of well-managed gardens, crops or pastures.\n\nAgriculture: Cut-leaf Mignonette contaminates produce (both foliage and seed crops) and competes with field crops for light and nutrients.  A weed of cereals, vegetables, seedling lucerne, potatoes, sugar beet, carrots, pastures, fire breaks, fallows, roadsides, riverbanks and disturbed land. It also has the potential to cause major losses in vegetable crops (particularly beet, potato and carrots in Europe) as well as hosting vegetable pests and diseases such as Cucumber Mosaic Virus and Cabbage Root Fly (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Animal and Plant Control Commission of SA 2002). In Australia its greatest potential impact appears to be in cereal crops (Walsh 2007, pers. comm.). Cut-leaf Mignonette is an effective competitor in cereal crops, and can severely reduce yields and the cost of control is expensive. A heavy infestation in a cereal crop can reduce yield by up to 60%. It has been estimated that the cost to the South Australian grains industry due to Cut-leaf Mignonette infestations is approximately $2.2 million per annum. The seed is an unwanted contaminant of broad acre crops and hard to clean from harvested grain. Crops contaminated with Cut-leaf Mignonette can be downgraded in quality resulting in economic losses. Cut-leaf Mignonette is of some use as fodder on land that is too poor for sown pastures to be economically viable. However, it is unpalatable and is only grazed when no other feed is available Government of South Australia (2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Can invade sandy coastal vegetation and roadside reserves.",

It is also a common weed in pastures, along roadsides and in wastelands (Auld & Medd 1987; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Navie 2004).\n\nAgriculture: Wild radish is relatively unpalatable to stock and can be toxic if ingested. It is one of the most widespread and serious weeds of cereal and pulse crops in southern temperate and sub- humid Australia (Alemseged et al. 2001; Cousens et al. 1993; Cheam & Lee 2006; Newman et al. 2007). It is a difficult and expensive species to control and it causes significant production losses in cropping enterprises due to its highly competitive nature (Cheam & Code 1998; Cheam & Lee 2006; Hashem 2006). In cropping situations, not only does it compete vigorously for light, nutrients and moisture but the tough stems interfere with harvesting equipment, its seeds are difficult to separate from contaminated grain and it acts as a host to numerous plant pests (Cheam & Code 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In pastures, if eaten, it can taint meat and dairy products and can poison livestock (Cheam & Code 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Wild radish is also an alternative host or reservoir for a number of pathogen and insect pests of grain crops (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nNative ecosystems:  While this species is mostly a weed of agricultural areas and habitation, wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) is also troublesome in natural vegetation in some areas, open grassland and open woodland vegetation, and especially in vegetation subject to disturbance, and on the margins in roadsides.\n\nUrban areas: Also a weed of roadsides, parks and gardens  waste, abandoned and little used areas, especially where disturbance occurs.",

In southern parts of the United States, Kudzu has infested about 3 million hectares and causes US $500 million damage per annum in lost productivity and control costs (North Coast Weeds Advisory Committee 2004; The Weed Society of Queensland 2006).

Its extremely rapid growth rate and habit of growing over objects threatens natural areas by smothering native vegetation. The rampant growth of Kudzu severely threatens biodiversity through restricting germination of plant seedlings, reducing the amount and diversity of food resources for native fauna and impacting on other habitat values.\n\nHuman: It restricts human movement, smothers fences, power lines, rail lines and other infrastructure and reduces scenic values (Miller 2003; North Coast Weeds Advisory Committee 2004; Turnbull & Storrie 2004; EPPO 2007).",

It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. Environmental impacts include land erosion resulting from the loss of grassland habitat that supports native plants and animals; and the provision of safe refuges for feral animals such as pigs and cats (CRC 2003). Mesquite can also increase land degradation and loss of soil moisture due to its extensive and deep root system (Osmond 2003).\n\nAgricultural: Mesquite’s economic impacts stem from its habit of forming dense, impenetrable thickets which, combined with its large thorns, prevent stock accessing watering holes and make mustering difficult. Mesquite also reduces the productivity of pastoral country by taking over grasslands and using valuable water resources. The sharp thorns damage animal hooves, puncture vehicle tyres, and inflict injury to people (Osmond 2003). Livestock which consume excessive amounts of seed pods can be poisoned (CRC 2003).\n\nEnvironment: Mesquite can cause increased land degradation and loss of soil moisture. It reduces biodiversity by outcompeting native plants. It also acts as a refuge for feral animals (Osmond 2003).\n\nHuman: In 2003 it was estimated that $20000 per year was spent on the medical treatment for injuries caused by the the thorns of Mesquite (E Miller pers. comm. in Osmond 2003).",

    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Purpleflower Devil's Claw is not known to have any major impact on native flora and fauna as it occurs singly or in small patches, rarely forming large colonies, and most often only occurs on disturbed land. It is only documented as occurring in semi arid to arid natural ecosystems. However, as it is a low growing herb, it may have potential to displace other herbs, forbs or grasses (Agriculture Victoria 2021).\n\nAgriculture: A weed of pastures in drier areas. While stock do not graze this plant due to the sticky discharge, serious injury can occur to animals if the hard, clawed (horned) fruit are caught in the mouth or nose. The fruit can also cause damage when the claws work into the animal's body or feet (Robbins et al. 1970; Parson 1973; Lamp & Collet 1976; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001), or lodge around the animals mouth preventing feeding and animals can stave to death. However its preferred habitat it river flats and horticultural crops. This species can compete strongly with summer and horticultural crops such as cotton, and it is particularly drought tolerant due to its extensive root system (Agriculture Victoria 2021; Parsons 1973), with the woody fruits interfering with harvesting causing damage to machinery. Purpleflower Devil's Claw is also grown for its fruit, which are collected when young, and then pickled (Robbins et al. 1970; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "impact": "Although considered native to northern Australia, Water Lettuce is regarded as a weed in many parts of Australia where it can have impacts on the environment, agriculture, recreation and water supplies.\n\nWater Lettuce is regarded as one of the world's worst weeds (Holm et al. 1977). In Australia it is potentially a serious weed of warm-watered, still to slow-flowing waterbodies. Once established, it spreads quickly over the entire surface of freshwater lakes, ponds, sluggish streams and rivers, canals and other bodies of water (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nProblems occur when the stolon-connected rosettes form extensive dense mats, which obstruct waterways and dams, impeding water traffic, hydroelectric systems and irrigation, and interfering with recreational activities such as boating, swimming and fishing. They hinder flood control efforts by blocking and disrupting water flow in drainage channels. Children and livestock may drown if they become entangled in the roots of a heavy infestation (Land Protection 2006).\n\nAgriculture: There can be an increased water loss in summer in reservoirs by transpiration. Infestation by Water Lettuce can also pollute water with rotting plant material, affecting people, fish, livestock and wildlife (Land Protection 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: Invasion of habitats by Water Lettuce disrupts habitats and ecosystems. The dense plant mass reduces light penetration, oxygen concentrations and pH levels in the water, thus destroying the habitat of fish and waterfowl and can lead to a loss of biodiversity as it out-competes and displaces native water plants. It can also be a serious competitor in rice paddies, taking root in the soil and competing for nutrients and spaces (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nWater Lettuce may form a shelter for, and a breeding site of, disease-carrying mosquitoes, especially a hazard where mosquitoes carry parasites responsible for malaria, Ross River Fever and other diseases (Sainty & Jacobs 1981; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Land Protection 2006).\n\nWithin its natural range on the coastal floodplains of the Northern Territory, Water Lettuce plays an ecological role in initiating the formation of floating grass mats important for wildlife habitats; including nesting places for the saltwater crocodile (Gillett et al. 1989; Hills 1998). In the Northern Territory it is kept in check partly by the moth Nymphula tenebralis which lays its eggs on the leaves and the larvae then feed on the plant (Gillett et al. 1989; Hills 1998). Water Lettuce should only be treated as a noxious weed in made-made water storages in the Northern Territory (Gillet et al. 1989).",

Following an assessment process, Lippia was not included as one of the 20 WoNS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance. It is a serious environmental and pastoral weed in the Murray-Darling river system in Queensland and New South Wales. Lippia is well adapted to floodplains and adjacent areas, and is extremely difficult to control. In Queensland the area covered by Lippia was recorded as 1 million hectares from a total catchment of 2.5 million in the Condamine catchment, and 1.16 million hectares of the Border Rivers catchment (both New South Wales and Queensland) (Earl 2003). It has little to no grazing value and causes major environmental impacts in terms of increasing soil erosion and decreasing stream bank stability due to loss of perennial grasses and the reduction of plant diversity (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nAgriculture: Lippia probably imposes its most long-reaching impact on primary production in grazing country. It appears to be either unpalatable to stock and/or too short to be easily consumed. Infestations can dominate pastures and lead to reduced stocking rates or productivity of grazing lands. Sheep grazing on Lippia can develop copper deficiency which is detrimental to the quality of their wool. (Leigh & Walton 2004). An aggressive weed that out-competes pasture species, reducing stocking rates by up to 90% (DAF, Queensland Government 2020).\n\nIt is also thought that Lippia can reduce seed set in commercial crops as bees prefer Lippia to Lucerne flowers. As a result, pollination of the commercial crop is reduced. It may reduce water availability to crops and inhibit the germination and growth of other plant species, for example, lettuce crops. However, this inhibitory affect may be due to the dense mass of roots left by a Lippia infestation physically preventing other plants establishing rather than an allopathic affect (inhibition of establishment and growth of other individual plants or species by releasing chemical compounds into the environment) (Leigh & Walton 2004).\n\nNative ecosystems:  Lippia is an environmental and economic weed in some parts of Queensland and is already a significant problem in New South Wales (Leigh & Walton 2004). Serious environmental and pastoral weed in Murray-Darling river system. Poses a serious threat to protected wetland areas forming dense carpet-like spread prevents growth of other riparian vegetation. The spreading nature and deep rooting system of Lippia are some of the main concerns with this plant. Both characteristics are associated with stream bank and soil erosion, structural damage to roads, and high control costs (Leigh & Walton 2004). The plant has a taproot up to 2 metres deep and in river or creek bank situations these large taproots act like wedges and will actually cause large sections of the bank to break away and fall into the waterway (NWWCC 2002), resulting soil erosion, decreasing bank stability and degrading waterway health and quality.\n\nUrban areas: In urban areas it can invade lawns and take over especially in lawns prone to flooding.",

    "origin": "According to most literature, Lippia is native to the South American (Richardson 1994; USDA 2003), and naturalised elsewhere. However, as a widely cultivated species, the origins of this species are not clear. For example, Lippia has recently been recorded as having only a tropical to subtropical world distribution (Dellow et al. 2001) but this is not confirmed by its current distribution across a large range of climatic types (Leigh & Walton 2004).",

    "impact": "Parthenium Weed (Parthenium hysterophorus) is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, economic, environmental and health impacts. All parts of the Parthenium plant at any stage of growth are toxic to humans and animals.\n\nAgriculture: Parthenium Weed is a major problem in range-lands and summer-cropping areas (especially in Queensland), costing farmers and graziers over $22 million a year in reduced production and increased management costs. It has a serious impacts on the pastoral industry and readily colonises disturbed and heavily stocked areas, reduces both pasture establishment and potential, and is a host for crop viruses. It is somewhat toxic to livestock and taints meat and milk. Kaur (2014) reported that Parthenium Weed is toxic to animals causing dermatitis with pronounced skin lesions and is responsible for mouth-ulcers with excessive salivation on various animals including horses and cattle. Livestock do not usually eat Parthenium Weed but if no other feed is available, they may eat large amounts and this can cause kidney damage in ruminants (cattle, sheep and goats) (DPI NSW 2019). Kaur (2014) states that consumption is significant amounts of Parthenium Weed in cattle (10–50%) can kill. Young cattle are most susceptible to dying from parthenium poisoning (DPI NSW 2019). Parthenium Weed also contains chemicals and exerts strong allelopathic effects on different crops (prohibits the germination and growth of seeds), also affecting nodulation (production of nitrogen fixing bacteria) in legumes due to inhibition of activity of nitrogen fixing and nitrifying bacteria (Kaur 2014).\n\nNative ecosystems:  Parthenium Weed can invade native vegetation. In Queensland it threatens biodiversity in the Einasleigh Uplands bio-region and native grassland in the central highlands. Parthenium Weed has been reported to to causing a total habitat change in native Australian grasslands, open woodlands, river banks, and flood plains (Kaur 2014).\n\nUrban areas: Can invade urban areas and gardens further impacting people.\n\nPeople: Negatively impacts humans with the pollen grains and airborne dried plant parts, causing severe allergic dermatitis in some, while in others the pollen may cause hay fever, asthma (CRC 2003). The best way to prevent an allergic reaction to Parthenium Weed is to avoid contact with it, especially breathing pollen from flowering plants (CRC 2003). Physical contact can cause great discomfort (Kaur 2014).",

It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. Parkinsonia has the potential to invade more than three quarters of mainland Australia.\n\nAgriculture: Plants can form dense impenetrable thickets on rangelands and wetlands, making areas of land inaccessible for people and animals. Thickets can be up to several kilometres across. Cattle are difficult to muster in paddocks where Parkinsonia infestations are thick. Access to watering points is impaired by the thickets which also shade out valuable pastures and displaces native vegetation when left untreated. Parkinsonia can dam watercourses, cause erosion, and lower water tables. A very hardy plant that can withstand long dry spells. Seeds remain viable for many years (Smith 2002). Parkinsonia infestations provide refuges for feral animals especially pigs (CRC 2003; Deveze 2004).",

    "impact": "Soursob (Oxalis pes-caprae) is primarily a weed rapidly establishing and affecting cool to warm temperate, to semi arid, and sub-tropical cultivated or disturbed areas. It is not uncommon for infestations to have up to 3000 plants per square metre.\n\nAgriculture: At large densities, Soursob is strongly competitive with cereal crops and has been measured in Western Australia to reduce the yield of wheat by 75% and oats by 87% (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Yield losses in wheat of up to 50% have been recorded in South Australia. However, Soursob is no longer a major competitor with cereals and other broadacre crops, where it is readily controlled by herbicides and most landholders see the value of keeping properties free of the weed. Soursob is also important in pastures where it may replace almost all desirable plants from the time of the autumn rains to well into the spring potentially seriously reducing in carrying capacity. Although it grows in permanent pastures, it is very slow to spread without soil movement or cultivation.\n\nSoursob is poisonous to stock due to a high concentration of oxalate in all its parts. The oxalate ion precipitates as insoluble calcium oxalate crystals in the brain or kidneys. Sheep are most susceptible at the start of the season when they are not accustomed to the plant. Sheep that have been exposed to Soursob are seldom seriously affected as they build up a bacterial population in the rumen capable of breaking down oxalates (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nSome orchardists and vine growers value Soursob for the ability of its roots and rhizomes in helping break up clay soils, improving aeration and water penetration. It is also thought to be useful in honey production (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: It is also an important weed of bush land, where its low, spreading growth in autumn quickly covers the ground, preventing germination of other seedlings and smothering surrounding plants (Blood 2001). Soursob has a severe impact on indigenous ground-flora with dense infestations eradicating most smaller plants. It occurs in medium to large populations in a number of different vegetative communities including; dry coastal vegetation and some dunes, heathland & woody heathland, lowland grassland & grassy woodland; dry sclerophyll forest & woodland, riparian vegetation, and rock outcrop vegetation, no doubt also impacting on the habitat of native fauna.\n\nUrban areas: A common and persistent weed in gardens, lawns, on roads sides, and in amenity plantings, and neglected and abandoned areas. Known to be mildly toxic to humans, especially when consumed in larger quantities.",
    "controlMethods": "NO",
    "origin": "Soursob originated in South Africa and, with several other species of Oxalis, was taken to Europe in the 18th century for promotion as an ornamental plant. It soon became established as a weed in southern Europe where it is common in orchards, vineyards and cereal crops, particularly in Italy, Greece, Malta and Portugal. From Europe it has spread all over the world including Australia and it is also a troublesome weed in other including North and South America, New Zealand, Morocco, India, Israel, Lebanon, Tunisia and even in its native South Africa (where it is proclaimed a noxious weed) (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "impact": "Prickly Pears (Opuntia) can form dense patches that are virtually impenetrable to people and most animals and can harbour pest species. Opuntia species can have serious impacts on agriculture, the environment, and aesthetically posing a risk to human and animal welfare and safety (Sheehan & Potter 2017).\n\nAgriculture: Prickly Pears can form dense patches that are virtually impenetrable to stock and other animals, and can harbour pest species such as rabbits. Furthermore, the fruits of some species can harbour fruit fly which can be difficult to eradicate without destroying all the fruits within a population. These species are not readily grazed due to their stout spines, and these can cause injury to animals and humans as they readily pierce the skin, cause irritation, and glochids can be difficult to remove. Where they occur in dense patches on cultivated land they can significantly reduce land productivity (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems:  Although scattered plants have little effect on native ecosystems, dense infestations can affect biodiversity by hindering the growth and regeneration of native plants, particularly small shrubs and ground-flora (Muyt 2001).\n\nUrban areas: Plants can take over in neglected or abandoned areas, and can further spread to similar areas, roads verges and reserves, in towns and cities in arid to temperate areas.\n\nHealth and safety concerns: Plants can cause serious injury to humans and domestic pets. Physical injury associated with Opuntia species is from the spines and glochids. These are borne on the areoles on pads and flowering and fruiting body (Chinnock 2015). The large spines can can inflict considerable injury, penetrating skin requiring careful removal to avoid further damage. Removal of spines can result in bleeding followed by bruising, and in rare cases serious infection, and in extreme cases death can occur (Chinnock 2015). Glochids are small hair-like sharp detachable spines with reverse barbs produced in dense cluster on the areoles. These small glochids penetrate and irritate skin, and are barely visible to impossible to see with out the aid of a hand-lens. These features create difficulties when trying to identify the remove glochids from affected skin. Even glochids detached from plant on equipment, surfaces or clothes can also penetrate skin if brushed past.\n\nFor further information on impacts and safety and wellbeing see, ‘Managing Opuntioid Cacti in Australia; Best practice control manual for Austrocylindropuntia, Cylindropuntia and Opuntia species’ at: https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/sites/gateway/files/Opuntioid%20cacti%20best%20practice%20control%20manual.pdf",

    "impact": "Taurian Thistle (Onopordum tauricum) is one of seventeen sleeper weeds identified by the Bureau of Rural Sciences (following consultation with the Australian Weeds Committee) which could have nationally significant impacts on agriculture if allowed to spread. Could seriously impact agricultural and other disturbed areas including native vegetation and urban areas.\n\nAgriculture: Taurian Thistle has the potential to become a serious agricultural weed, especially in marginal or overgrazed areas or and bare patches and disturbed sites /  It will occupy space in pasture, deterring grazing animals and humans, contaminating fodder, invading grain crops reducing growth, and contaminating marketable grain. Severe infestations can form tall, dense, impenetrable stands which restrict access of large mammals to foraging and watering areas and may harbour pest species. The spiny leaves and stems deter most herbivores except maybe goats (which graze on related spiny thistles like Onopordum illyricum). It may have a major impact on the carrying capacity of infested pasture land by more than 5% (Healy, Enloe & DiTomaso 2005; RBWD 2005; DPI 2007). It is possible that Taurian Thistle could contaminate wool, similarly to the related (Onopordum acanthium & O. illyricum) (DPI 2007)\n\nNative ecosystems: Although thought to be a serious weed of agriculture, Taurian Thistle could also invade open native vegetation and degraded and disturbed vegetation. Taurian Thistle seedlings do not compete well with established perennial grasses. It requires open space to establish and establishes in highly disturbed ecosystems. It is therefore unlikely to have a major impact on intact ecosystems (Healy, Enloe & DiTomaso 2005; DPI 2007). In grasslands and open scrub it can strongly compete with native plants for resources and may have a minor impact on the forb and herb layers, but not on the shrub layer ecosystems (Healy, Enloe & DiTomaso 2005; DPI 2007). In grassland and open scrub, where this plant invades the dried vegetation adds to the fuel load, most likely causing a moderate increase in the intensity of fires (Davis 1975; DPI 2007). Taurian Thistle plant will reduce the amount of native vegetation growing and also its availability as a food source to native animals. Infestations may reduce the number of animals in a local area (DPI 2007).\n\nUrban areas: Could impact roadside and parks and gardens, and abandoned areas around habitations and towns. Large dense infestations can form impenetrable stands which restrict access of people to recreation areas.",

Once established thistles are difficult and expensive to control. Dense thistle populations can reduce property values.\n\nAgriculture: Onopordum spp. are significant pasture and cropping weeds. All three species of Onopordum have a serious impact on agricultural production by occupying space in pastures and crops thus reducing production.  Large rosettes can prevent the growth of desirable species. Their prickly nature means livestock rarely eat them, or if they do cause injury to stock. They also reducing the value of grain and hay by increasing the likelihood of contamination with seeds of these declared noxious weeds. (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Hussey et al. 1997; Dellow & Holtkamp 2005). Dense stands of mature thistles create barriers that hinder livestock movement. Parts of the plant can break off causing vegetable fault and thus a loss in value for the wool. Thistles can cause injury to livestock and people handling the livestock or fleece. Thistles are prolific seeders and can spread quickly if not controlled (DPI NSW 2008)\n\nNative ecosystems: Although a serious weed of agriculture, also invades open native vegetation and degraded and disturbed vegetation.\n\nUrban areas: Found along roadsides and waste areas, abandoned blocks, and in parks and in gardens.",

    "impact": "European Olive has impacts on both environment and agriculture and has become a major environmental weed in parts of temperate to humid south-east of Australia, mainly South Australia and Victoria. Government of South Australia (2021) states that self-sown seedlings establish on roadsides, in bush and abandoned pasture and may be slow-growing at first, with a juvenile period of 5-10 years before they begin to bear fruit. But established olive trees form a dense and permanent canopy that prevents other vegetation from re-establishing. Individual trees live for many centuries and retain the ability to regenerate from stumps after felling or burning, as well as forming a large seedbank in the soil. Olives are very long lived and accumulate a large seedbank. It is estimated that individual olive trees in the Mediterranean region are more than 1500 years old (Government of South Australia 2021). It is widely planted as a commercial crop in Australia and gradually becoming a severe bushland weed. The pollen a known allergen causing hay fever in susceptible individuals.\n\nAgriculture: In grazing paddocks, the plant may be effectively controlled by stock, as it is quite palatable, but it can become a major weed of parkland where grazing is low or absent.  Olives are highly flammable due to their oil content and therefore increase fire risk compared to grazing or other horticulture Government of South Australia (2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Olives are very adept at invading and establishing in new environments to become the dominant plant species and is able to invade most healthy intact native vegetation, including woodlands, grasslands, and is a major pest plant of grassy woodlands and invade riverine environments (Agriculture Victoria 2021). Olives out compete native vegetation reducing both floral and faunal biodiversity, and contain volatile oils increasing bushfire risk. It can alter the composition of native vegetation by shading and crowding out other species and preventing their regeneration (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Muyt 2001). Olive infestations reduce the abundance and diversity of native plant species, altering the canopy structure of woodlands and preventing native regeneration. Native canopy cover may be reduced by 80% and native species diversity by 50% (Government of South Australia 2021). However, the infestations providing a fruit crop rich in fats can be significant for many small bird and mammal species. Species reported eating the fruit and dispersing the seed include many birds including emu, currawong and silvereye, and other animals like wombats (Agriculture Victoria 2021), with seeds spread by animals particularly birds in to new weed free natural areas and other environments.\n\nUrban areas: A weed of roadsides and waste land, parks and urban plantings, and pockets of remnant and re-vegetated native vegetation.",

    "impact": "Water Dropwort (Oenanthe pimpinelloides) is one of seventeen sleeper weeds identified by the Bureau of Rural Sciences (following consultation with the Australian Weeds Committee) which could have nationally significant impacts on agriculture if allowed to spread.\n\nAgriculture:  Water Dropwort appears to replace pasture species and competes with native species during summer (Government of South Australia 2014). Cunningham & Brown (2006) also report that Water Dropwort has the potential to invade pastures and replace preferred gazing species.  In South Australia in early 2006, Water Dropwort was reported as being limited to one infestation of about 35 hectares (net area) or 84.2 hectares (gross area) where it was impacting on crops and pastures, and at a second site of less than one hectare in Victoria (Cunningham & Brown 2006; Cunningham et al. 2006). Cropping, grazing and horticulture are the land uses potentially at risk from spread of this species in its potential climatic range in southern temperate Australia (CSIRO 2002, in Cunningham & Brown 2006).\n\nThe potential for Water Dropwort to invade pasture and forestry plantations, and its potential to grow in a range of Tasmanian environments, resulted in its listing as a declared weed for that State (DPIPWE Tasmania 2019). The roots are sometimes eaten overseas but caution is required because many species of Oenanthe are poisonous to stock and humans. However, there are no reports of livestock poisoning even though sheep graze on this species. (Cunningham et al. 2003). However, livestock do not usually graze on it, and it has been reported to be poisonous (Government of South Australia 2014).\n\nNative ecosystems: It could also impact on natural ecosystems by out-competing native plants (Kodela 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nUrban areas:  Not known from urban areas, but may be able invade ephemeral riparian areas in urban environments.",

    "impact": "Serrated Tussock is a Weed of National Significance as it is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. In New South Wales alone it has been estimated that the weed has cost more than $40 million in lost production (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: It causes significant problems in grazing lands with poor soil fertility and low rainfall where the benefits of control are marginal. It is also unpalatable to livestock and will only be eaten by sheep and cattle if nothing else is available (Osmond et al. 2008, Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Serrated Tussock has no grazing value because of its high fibre and low protein content. Its low nutritional value is insufficient to meet livestock requirements and if live stock are forced to graze pastures containing only Serrated Tussock, the leaves can form indigestible balls in the rumen, causing loss of condition and eventual death (Osmond et al. 2008). Infestations result in a significant loss in livestock production and and Serrated Tussock probably accounts for a greater reduction in pasture carrying capacity than any other weed in Australia (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Dense infestations may completely dominate pastures, making large areas incapable of supporting livestock. Pastures that can normally carry carry 7-15 dry sheep equivalent (DSE) per hectare (ha) can be reduced to a carrying capacity of only 0.5 DSE per ha. In addition, the seeds with awn can contaminate wool (CRC 2003). Its seeds also contaminate hay and grain and other produce (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nNative ecosystems: Serrated Tussock can readily establish in environmentally significant native grasslands reducing biodiversity as dense infestations can out-compete and eliminate most other plants over large areas, also negatively impacting on native fauna (Osmond et al. 2008; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).  It can also invade other environmental significant area such as grassy woodlands, scelerophyll forest, dry open woodlands, and coastal vegetation (Osmond et al. 2008)\n\nUrban areas: Serrated Tussock can dominate road sides, parks, neglected areas, railways, power-line easements, reserves, and sporting grounds in and around towns and cities (Osmond et al. 2008). In urban areas it creates a fire hazard (CRC 2003), as the build-up of bio-mass increases fire intensity. Seed heads can catch fire, blow away, and start fires some distance away. Seed heads can also block eves causing increased fire risk. Fire season is increased in areas with large infestations.",

It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. It is closely related to another Weed of National Significance, Serrated Tussock (Nassella trichotoma) (CRC 2003). Chilean Needle Grass affects sown pasture, native grasslands and urban and amenity areas of southern and south-eastern Australia.\n\nAgriculture: It is relatively unpalatable and lower in nutrients than improved pastures, reducing farm productivity by displacing more desirable pasture species. Heavy infestations can decrease productivity by as much as 50% during summer (CRC 2003). It can completely overrun pastures resulting in a canopy cover of up to 60%, which leads to a substantial reduction of stock carrying capacity during late spring and summer when the weed produces large quantities of unpalatable flower stalks (Grech et al. 2004).\n\nThe sharp seeds have a natural twisting mechanism that cause seeds to lodge into fleece, skin, eyes and ears of livestock in response to changes in humidity (Weeds Australia). In New Zealand and eastern states of Australia the seeds have been found to move through the skin and into the body muscles, causing abscesses and downgrading carcasses, and even rendering them unsalable (Weeds Australia, no date). These impacts can significantly affect the value of agricultural products.\n\nNative ecosystems: Chilean Needle Grass is possibly the worst environmental weed threatening endangered indigenous grasslands in south-eastern Australia (Laconis 2004). Chilean Needle Grass can rapidly invade disturbed soils and degraded ecosystems. It is also invading grassy open woodlands and riparian vegetation in many areas. Chilean Needle Grass will out-compete and displace native grasses and herbs, interfere with re-vegetation programs and once established are difficult to manage. Degradation of native habitats including grassland and other habitats will have impacts on native birds and other fauna.\n\nUrban areas:The seeds of Chilean Needle Grass are also known to cause discomfort to dogs and humans, thereby restricting human access in recreational and other areas (Weeds Australia), and is a weed of amenity and neglected areas, parks, gardens, reserves and sporting grounds.",

    "impact": "Texas Needle Grass forms dense infestations in pasture, native grasslands and woodlands where it can exclude desirable species. It has low feed value to stock, and is not palatable so tends to be allowed to increase as long as more palatable pasture species are present (Government of South Australia 2021), considered one of Australia’s worst weeds of native grasslands and pasture. If allowed to spread unchecked it is likely to have major environmental and economic costs (Government of South Australia 2019).\n\nAgriculture: Reduces stock carrying capacity due to the production of masses of unpalatable flower stalks and provides very little leaf material during the warmer months and displaces desirable pasture species during spring and summer. Because the plant is avoided by grazing animals, infestations commonly expand as other species are selectively grazed out. Texas Needle Grass is considered a danger to livestock. The sharp, needle like points on the seeds can damage the eyes and face area and have been known to blind livestock. the sharp seeds penetrates wool, skin and underlying muscle of grazing animals resulting in injury, infection and the downgrading of wool, hides and carcasses (Government of South Australia 2019). Texas Needle Grass is considered a high value pasture crop as it remains green when other pasture is drying up. Stock are removed when the plants are in seed. In Australia the agricultural impact is considered negative due to the high invasive potential, loss of grazing land as well as the financial cost and time involved in removing this hardy weed species (Penhall et al. 2000; Magee 2005).\n\nNative ecosystems: Biodiversity values are negatively affected by Texas Needle Grass through direct completion with native grassland species. It is considered one of the 49 non-native species that have a direct impact on Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) rated rare or threatened plants within Victoria (Groves et al. 2003; Obst 2004). In native grasslands it displaces native forbs and grasses such as kangaroo grass and spear grass (Government of South Australia 2019).",

Lobed Needle Grass is closely related to Serrated Tussock (Nassella trichotoma), a Weed of National Significance that costs south-eastern Australia's grazing industries more than $40 million a year in control expenditure and lost production (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: Even in its native Argentina, where the relatively unpalatable serrated tussock (Nassella trichotoma) and Chilean Needle Grass (N. neesiana) are used as fodder, Lobed Needle Grass is regarded as a serious weed due to its invasiveness and competitiveness and lack of usefulness as fodder. It is drought tolerant and forms dense infestations. While cattle may be able to tolerate Lobed Needle Grass, it is a major problem for sheep because the sharp seeds can damage skins and carcasses and contaminate fleeces. As seen with the closely related Serrated Tussock and Chilean Needle Grass, infestations of Lobed Needle Grass would result in significant loss in livestock production (CRC 2003). Nassella charruana shares the unpalatability traits of N. trichotoma and also the injurious seeds of N. neesiana, and within its native range, this species is considered highly competitive, even displacing other Nassella species. For these reasons, N. charruana poses a significant threat to temperate rangelands, particularly those with high rainfall and soil fertility Humphries & Florentine (2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Lobed Needle Grass is a successful competitor with native grasses and is impacting on native grasslands and open woodlands. Lobed needle grass forms dense competitive infestations.

It can invade rice fields, affecting crop yield (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: While Parrot's Feather may provide cover for some aquatic organisms, it can seriously change physical (e.g. reducing light) and chemical characteristics of water bodies. Infestations alter aquatic ecosystems by shading out algae that are the basis of the aquatic food chain. Dense stands displace and exclude native water plant species, reducing the natural biological diversity, as has been observed in nutrient-enriched coastal or brackish water conditions (Weber 2003; EPPO 2008).",

In Western Australia it is a common weed of woodlands, granite rocks and limestone heaths throughout the south-west. It severely impedes the growth and regeneration of native ground-flora (Hussey et al. 1997; Muyt 2001; CSIRO Entomology 2007).",

    "impact": "Giant Sensitive Plant is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nAgriculture: Giant Sensitive Plant forms dense stands that replace all native vegetation on the ecologically and economically valuable wetlands of the Top End of northern Australia. Giant Sensitive Plant invasion threatens the production, cultural and conservation values of wetlands, and reduces the scope for exploitation of resources by land users. Pastoralists are affected because the inedible and thorny Giant Sensitive Plant smothers and replaces grasslands, blocks access to stock watering points and hinders mustering. Additionally, the harvesting of bush foods by indigenous people is hampered by Giant Sensitive Plant (CRC 2003).\n\nNative ecosystems: In environmental terms, nationally and internationally significant wetlands are threatened by Giant Sensitive Plant, which reduces the biodiversity of plant and animal life on the floodplains by out-competing native plants and reducing available habitat for native animals. Although currently limited in distribution, if left unchecked Giant Sensitive Plant has the potential to dominate wetlands across the whole of northern Australia (CRC 2003).\n\nCultural: Giant Sensitive Plant infestations can reduce access to areas for fishing and recreation. This is especially important as it affects the ability of indigenous groups to participate in cultural hunting and food collection such as turtles, water lilies and water chestnuts (Australian Government 2009). It also reduces accessibility to some indigenous sacred and cultural sites.\n\nA more detailed analysis of the impact of Giant Sensitive Plant on the environment is available in Walden et al. (2004).",

Its shoots have been reported to grow up to 27 mm a day. Vegetative reproduction is also efficient and vigorous. Although intolerant of heavy shade it readily colonises gaps (GISD 2005).\n\nAgriculture: Vigorous infestations damage or kill other plants by cutting out the light and smothering them. In this respect it is especially damaging in young plantations and nurseries.

Thriving in humid tropical areas, it has the potential to cause serious damage to agriculture (including sugar cane, tropical fruit and vegetable production) and native vegetation in northern Australia (NRW 2005).\n\nSeveral of the known infestations abut the rainforests of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area in north Queensland (Waterhouse 2003).

It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. All parts of African Boxthorn (fruit, leaves, stem and roots) are poisonous to people, livestock and other animal species, although the level of risk is believed to be low (Noble and Rose 2013).\n\nAgriculture: African Boxthorn can spread quickly if left unchecked. Having established it can rapidly form impenetrable, spiny thickets reducing stock movement and also the land available for pasture. Since birds are often the dispersing agent, infestations are commonly found around the base of taller trees. The fruit of African Boxthorn is a breeding ground for insect pests such as fruit fly, dried fruit beetles and tomato fly (Land Protection 2006). The taproot of the weed must be removed for control purposes otherwise it may produce re-growth, or if it is killed, it may still remain a hazard to stock and tyres because of its hardness and persistence (Land Protection 2006). The plant becomes a nuisance along fences, creeks,  and around dams and leaking troughs where it blocks passage along roads and prevents stock access to watering points. Leaves may be toxic to poultry (Noble and Rose 2013). Impenetrable thickets are sometimes regarded as shelter for livestock (Barker 2007, pers. comm.).\n\nNative ecosystems: African Boxthorn also impacts the natural environment, e.g. displacing native vegetation and degrading fauna habitat.  Dense infestations may provide a haven for feral animals such as rabbits, sparrows (Land Protection 2006) foxes, feral pigs (Sus scrofa) and starlings (Noble and Rose 2013). However, impenetrable thickets are often cited as havens for small native birds and animals. Where African Boxthorn infests coastal areas and offshore islands it can significantly alter and interfere with native fauna habitats and has becomes the only woody plant present, changing the vegetation structure (Noble and Rose 2013). On islands off South Australia and Western Australia, African Boxthorn displaces the native shrub Nitraria billardieri, which is used by seals (Arctocephalus spp.) to shelter their pups. African Boxthorn does not provide an equivalent nursery habitat, leaving pups more vulnerable to predation. On islands inhabited by Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea), such as East Beagle Island off the coast of Western Australia, African Boxthorn grows down to the beach and is known to impede the sea lions’ access to the island for pupping. It also impacts various sea birds and birds have become entangled in the woody spiny plant and died.\n\nUrban areas: Invades areas on urban fringes and abandon land and can forms impenetrable stands for people.",

Very long stems layer profusely, with moderate-fast growth rate.\n\nAgriculture: Not a known weed of agriculture, can be present in vegetation around margins of paddocks.\n\nNative ecosystems: Japanese Honeysuckle is a highly invasive environmental weed that is capable of smothering and out competing native vegetation by climbing over shrubs, up tree branches and across ground flora to form extensive suckering mats which also prevent further regeneration of native species. This process results in a significant reduction in the diversity of native flora (Muyt 2001; GISD 2005) and associated fauna. It is a very serious threat to native vegetation in heathland and heathy woodland, damp sclerophyll forest, wet sclerophyll forest, warm temperate rainforest and along streams (Carr et al. 1992). In NSW and Queensland it is also weedy and naturalised in or near rainforests and other closed forests, particularly those close to habitation. It also grows in riparian areas, distrubed sites and waste areas in wetter temperate, sub-tropical and tropical regions (Brisbane City Council 2021).\n\nUrban environments: Can escape gardens and establish in semi-urban environments and roadside vegetation.\n\nHuman impacts: Japanese honeysuckle is toxic to humans, causing discomfort and irritation but is not life threatening. The berries and leaves are poisonous if ingested, causing gastro-intestinal irritation. It is also a skin irritant causing rashes on contact with the plant.\n\nWhat to do if poisoning occurs:\n\nIf the patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nIf the patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",

However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nNative ecosystems: Chinese Privet is a significant environmental weed in New South Wales and Queensland, and an emerging or potential environmental weed in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. It is of most concern in south-eastern Queensland, where it is ranked among the top 25 environmental weeds, and in eastern New South Wales (Batianoff & Butler 2002; Navie & Adkins 2007). Chinese Privet invades gullies, creeklines, watercourses, forest gaps and the margins of rainforests and forms dense thickets that shade out other plants. It out-competes or suppresses native vegetation and can dominate the shrub layer of an invaded habitat, altering the composition and structure of the community. This transforms the habitat available to native animals and stands of this weed may also hinder animal movement through bushland areas (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nHuman impacts: The leaves and fruit of Chinese Privet are poisonous to livestock and humans. It also produces masses of heavily scented white flowers that cause severe allergic reactions in susceptible people (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nAgriculture: An unidentified toxin in the leaves and fruit of narrow leaf privet may cause tremors and seizures in poultry.

However, it remains a weed of potential national signficance.\n\nNative ecosystems: Broad-leaf Privet causes widespread and significant environmental damage in eastern Australia. It is regarded as an environmental weed or potential environmental weed in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory, and is currently of most concern in south-eastern Queensland and eastern New South Wales. Broad-leaf Privet has become an invasive weed of rainforests, gullies and waterways and can invade relatively intact rainforest communities. It can form dense thickets, particularly in coastal areas, which shade out and displace native species. This can transform the habitat available to native animals, creating an ecosystem dominated by weeds, and disrupting the access of animals to natural corridors (Land Protection 2006; Navie & Adkins 2007). Broad-leaf Privet also supports artificially high numbers of pied currawongs (Strepera graculina) in New South Wales, disrupting the natural ecological balance and adversely affecting other native birds (Blood 2001).\n\nIn New South Wales Broad-leaf Privet is present in coastal districts north from Bega, on the far south coast, and inland to West Wyalong. It is widely distributed throughout south-eastern Queensland and can also be found on the Atherton Tablelands, in northern Queensland. Small naturalised populations also exist in north-eastern and southern Victoria, where it is regarded as a potential threat to grasslands, woodlands, riparian vegetation and eucalypt forests (Navie &Adkins 2007).\n\nHuman impacts: The leaves and fruit of this species are poisonous to livestock and humans (Navie & Adkins 2007). Broad-leaf Privet pollen is also known to cause significant irritation to hay fever sufferers (Mowatt 1998).",

Although not poisonous to stock,  is unpalatable to livestock, and imparts a disagreeable taste to milk if eaten by cattle. Plants produce copious seed (1 300-26 000 per plant) which may remain dormant in the soil for as long as 20 years or more. In the United States of America, Ox-eye Daisy hosts viruses that may affect crop species, but it is not known if, or to what extent, this might occur in Australia (Howarth & Williams 1968; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Ox-eye Daisy invades lowland grassland and grassy woodlands, damp sclerophyll forests, riparian vegetation, alpine and sub-alpine vegetation (Carr et al. 1992) and out-competes native plants including some endangered species DPI NSW (2019). Dense infestations  are capable of displacing native plants and it is not readily grazed by native animals, no doubt reducing resources (food sources) available for native fauna.\n\nUrban areas: Invades roadside vegetation and nature parks.",

In established lucerne it can be competitive if present in large numbers. It is seldom grazed but milk and meat may become tainted if plants are consumed for about a week after ingestion. It has poisonous properties and is suspected of causing stock losses but rarely eaten in sufficient quantity to cause problems. Established infestations are very difficult to eradicate, mainly because of the vigorous perennial root system. The roots of Hoary Cress contain chemicals that hinder the germination and growth of companion plants, especially cereals. Infestations can completely dominate fields and, when in flower, form massive drifts of white (Faithfull 1998; Agriculture Western Australia 2005; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; DPIW 2002).

It is one of the species from which lavender oil is distilled for use in perfume manufacture (to perfume soaps, toiletries and other products), as well as extracts used in Europe for herbal medicines. Oil from this species was prized by artists for varnishing, and the flowers are claimed to be important in honey production. Topped Lavender is used in air fresheners and insecticides. It was advocated for sand-binding in earlier times (Kloot 1987; Conn 1992, 1999; Blaylock & Moerkerk 2000; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). However, it is a weed of native ecosystems, agriculture and urban areas, found on roadsides, streams and creek margins, drainage lines, disturbed areas and poor pastures and open woodlands and grasslands.\n\nNative ecosystems: As a weed, Topped Lavender forms dense patches that eliminate and exclude ground-dwelling flora and smaller shrubs, as well as impeding regeneration of overstorey plants and impacting on native vegetation and biodiversity. Topped Lavender has invaded areas of conservation significance. For example, it is one of a number of invasive weeds threatening the survival of the rare White Beauty Spider Orchid in the Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia (CRC for Australian Weed Management 2004; Watts & Vidler 2006; Bowcher 2007). A weed of open grassy woodlands, and grasslands in Mediterranean type climates.\n\nAgriculture: It can also have impacts on agriculture. It is not eaten by domestic stock and out-competes desirable pasture species, reducing the carrying capacity of the land and causing the loss of production. Heavy grazing around infestations encourages its spread and dense stands may also harbour rabbits (Thorp & Wilson 1998 – ; Muyt 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; CRC for Australian Weed management). Topped Lavender establishes well on bare soil and in disturbed sites, persisting and becoming dominant once established, to the detriment of other vegetation (Weber 2003).\n\nUrban areas: Also invades roadsides, wasteland, and persists in abandoned gardens and little cared for areas, spreading by seed.",

Following an assessment process, Creeping Lantana was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national signficance.\n\nNative ecosystems: Little information is available on its environmental impact but it is known to readily displace native vegetation (CRC 2003). During successive dry seasons, Creeping Lantana can become an aggressive weed, due to its drought tolerance and scrambling growth form, replacing native grasses which may in turn affect grazing on native pastures (Everist 1981; Schultz 1994). It is believed to have the potential to impact on ecosystems in the same way as Lantana camara (North Coast Weed Read 2004) forming dense thickets that take over native bushland and impacting on biodiversity in affected areas.\n\nAgriculture: Creeping Lantana is toxic and suspected of poisoning cattle (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; CRC 2003).

    "impact": "Lantana (Lantana camara) is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. Lantana forms dense, impenetrable thickets impacting agricultural, native ecosystems, urban areas and human health.\n\nAgriculture: Lantana forms dense, impenetrable thickets that take over pastures on the east coast of Australia. It competes for resources with, and reduces the productivity of, pastures and forestry plantations. It adds fuel to fires, and is toxic to stock (CRC 2003).  There does not appear to be any documentation of palatability and toxicity to native fauna. Toxicity seems likely to be related to genetic factors, not environmental ones. Most variants of Lantana (Lantana camara) in Australia are toxic to domestic livestock (sheep, cattle) to some degree (CRC 2003). DPI NSW (2019) state that all types and parts of lantana are considered poisonous to stock. Red-flowered lantana is most dangerous and stock poisoning is common. It happens most when new animals are introduced into Lantana areas and there is no other feed. Cattle used to grazing lantana-infested land are less likely to eat it. Early symptoms of lantana poisoning include, depression, loss of appetite, constipation, frequent urination, jaundice for 1 – 2 days,  inflamed eyes with a slight discharge, mouth area becoming inflamed, moist, and very sensitive, with a pink nose, bare skin becoming very sensitive to light, red and swollen, or may crack, turn black, and die. Stock usually die 1–4 weeks after symptoms appear. Death is slow and painful from liver and kidney failure. Some animals have heart damage.\n\nNative ecosystems: Lantana forms dense, impenetrable thickets that also easily take over native bushland, adding fuel to fires (CRC 2003). Lantana is a serious threat to biodiversity in several World Heritage-listed areas including the Wet Tropics of northern Queensland, Fraser Island and the Greater Blue Mountains. Numerous plant and animal species of conservation significance are threatened. It is listed as the most significant environmental weed by the South-East Queensland Environmental Weeds Management Group. Lantana dominance appears to adversely affect the species richness of soil fauna assemblages, such as ants, and decreases the diversity of soil fungi. It can also affect flora diversity by reducing seedling germination and by increasing the chance and severity of fire in plant communities such as dry rainforest. Lantana has been identified as a potential threat to many threatened and endangered plants and animals and a number of endangered ecological communities (DECC 2007).\n\nUrban areas: Can invade urban areas and All parts of the plant are poisonous to humans if eaten and can cause vomiting, diarrhoea, weak muscles, breathing problems, and sometimes death. Touching Lantana can irritate skin and eyes. Some toxic reactions have been recorded in humans, especially children (DECC 2007). If poisoning occurs and:\n\nthe patient is unconscious, unresponsive or having difficulty breathing dial 000 or get to the emergency section of a hospital immediately.\nthe patient is conscious and responsive call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 or your doctor.\nIf going to a hospital take a piece of the plant for identification.",

It grows extremely quickly from the bottom of a water body to the surface and forms dense mats several metres thick at or just below the water surface. These mats stop light from penetrating the water and displace native vegetation. Dense infestations can also deplete oxygen in the water (CRC 2003). Native fish, waterbirds and other fauna could be affected where the growth becomes dense and restrictive (Land Protection 2006).\n\nAs a submerged aquatic weed, Lagarosiphon is particularly difficult to control and spreads very readily. If it became naturalised in Australia, there is little doubt that it would cause similar detrimental impacts and be as hard to control as it is in New Zealand (CRC 2003).\n\nHuman impacts: Infestations of Lagarosiphon choke waterways and reduce the potential for recreational use (e.g. fishing, boating, swimming, diving) and commercial use (e.g. by blocking water intakes for hydro-electricity) (CRC 2003). The long stems could block inlets to water pumping equipment and affect propellers and cooling systems of recreation equipment (Land Protection 2006).\n\nAn impact assessment of Lagarosiphon is provided by Victorian Resources online at http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/impact_Lagarosiphon",

It also invades pastures and disturbed sites such as mine sites and dumps. It is capable of completely covering large areas in both agricultural, disturbed and in some undisturbed environments, preventing regeneration (Hodgon 2006). Once established, eliminates all other vegetation, makes areas impenetrable because of the sharp spines for larger animals and people.\n\nAgriculture: Spiny Rush reduces the productivity of pasture areas by competing with preferred pasture plants and soon dominates as it is not readily eaten by grazing animals. It can also spread to impede water flow in drains and channels (Sainty & Jacobs 1981; Auld & Medd 1992; Cunningham et al. 1992), with serious obstruction able to cause flooding (Anderson et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).  Dense thickets also prevent access to water by livestock (Anderson et al. 1998), and the sharp points at the ends of the stems and leaves are capable of causing serious injury (Hodgon 2006; & Cuthbertson 2001). Stands also provide an effective harbour for pest animals such as rabbits (Cunningham et al. 1992; Anderson et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: Establishes in intact and disturbed natural ecosystems such as riparian vegetation and wetland areas.  Spiny Rush is not readily eaten by native grazing animals, and once established it can cover large areas eliminating and excluding other vegetation (Auld & Medd 1992; Cunningham et al. 1992; Anderson et al. 1998; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nHuman impacts: The sharp spines are a hazard to people, particularly to eyes, and are especially dangerous to children (Thorp & Wilson 1998 -).",

    "impact": "Bellyache Bush is a Weed of National Significance (WONS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nBellyache Bush has the capacity to form dense thickets which interfere with pasture growth, obscure fence lines, interfere with mustering and displace native vegetation (Pitt 1999). It is also poisonous to livestock and harbours feral animals (Csurhes 1999).\n\nThis toxic species is unpalatable to livestock, but accidental ingestion of Bellyache Bush seeds commonly occurs when animals browse on dry grass and fallen leaf litter during the dry season. In 1995, stock losses of 312 animals were attributed to Bellyache Bush in the Dalrymple shire in northern Queensland (Csurhes 1999).\n\nPure stands of Bellyache Bush also prevent the growth of pasture species and can render floodplain pastures totally unproductive. Bellyache Bush initially tends to invade disturbed areas and waterways. It eventually dominates these areas and then spreads slowly onto less disturbed land. At present, Bellyache Bush has a locally significant impact on grazing land along the banks of the Burdekin River and some of its tributaries. However, it has the potential to degrade grazing land over large areas of tropical grasslands and to threaten the future productivity of grazing enterprises in northern Australia. Declaration and preventative action by local and state government authorities has probably reduced the plant’s impact outside the heavily infested Burdekin catchment (Csurhes 1999).\n\nBellyache Bush is also regarded as an important environmental weed in the Northern Territory, Queensland and the northern parts of Western Australia (Smith 2002). It was recently listed as a priority environmental weed in five Natural Resource Management regions, and is ranked among the top 200 most invasive plant species in south-eastern Queensland (Batianoff & Butler 2002; Navie & Adkins 2007). Of particular concern is the impact that this species has on riparian habitats in semi-arid regions. In these areas it replaces native vegetation and may delay or prevent regeneration of native shrubs and trees (Smith 2002). Extensive Bellyache Bush thickets may also degrade wildlife habitat and reduce both plant and animal biodiversity at a local level (Csurhes 1999).\n\nBellyache Bush has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls",

It is a strong competitor and reduces crop yields (Richardson et al. 2007) and has also been reported as aggressively competing with native species (Richardson et al. 2007) The roots reach 2.5 metres deep consisting of both vertical and horizontal roots. Poverty Weed colonises cultivated land or overgrazed pastures. Aerial growth dies in autumn leaving the potential for surface soil erosion (Agriculture Victoria 2021).\n\nAgriculture: The extensive rhizome system produced by Poverty Weed allows it to strongly compete with crops, especially cereals, for water and nutrients. Rots extent for Both the above ground parts of the plant and the roots and rhizomes are known to reduce germination of other species, a potential threat to crop and pasture (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The plant is not thought to be toxic but, as it has a strong disagreeable scent, it is rarely grazed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: There is almost no information available about the impacts that the species has or potentially may have on Australian native ecosystems. Because Poverty Weed can form extensive clonal colonies, it has the potential to displace native grasses/forbs in open situations, particularly where there has been some disturbance. It has been assessed as posing a moderately high threat to Plains Grassy Woodland in the Wimmera bioregion. As the species prefers saline areas, it may also pose a threat to saline ecosystems, such as salt marsh communities (Department of Primary Industries 2000; Stajsic 2008 pers. comm.).\n\nUrban areas: In North America, Poverty Weed has been reported to cause contact dermatitis, and its pollen apparently exacerbates hay fever (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center 2006).",

However, as it is a low growing herb, it may have potential to displace other herbs, forbs or grasses (Victorian Resources Online 2007).\n\nAgriculture: While stock do not graze this plant due to the sticky discharge, serious injury can occur to animals if the hard, clawed fruit is caught in the mouth or nose. The fruit can also cause damage when the claws work into the animal's body or feet (Robbins et al. 1970; Parson 1973; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nThis species can compete strongly with summer crops such as cotton, and it is particularly drought tolerant due to its extensive root system (Parsons 1973; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). However, it has minimal impact on yield (Victorian Resources Online 2007).",

    "impact": "Knobweed is generally a problem in pastures that are low in nitrogen or are overgrazed (Flanagan 1998). It has a peculiar odour and bitter taste which making it unattractive to stock and thus reduces available grazing area. This results in the more palatable species being grazed preferentially, which encourages the spread of Knobweed. It is particularly persistent in degraded pastures, since the large reserves in the rootstock permit the weed to resprout faster than pasture species, even if damaged, which also reduces pasture competitiveness (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nKnobweed invades cultivated areas and is a common weed of other disturbed areas such as roadsides and creek banks (Friend 1983; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nOnce established, Knobweed's resilience to slashing and mowing and its prolific seeding ensure that it will remain troublesome (Flanagan 1998). Because it produces large quantities of seeds, when areas are cleared to establish pasture or other uses, Knobweed infestations may arise in these disturbed areas (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nKnobweed seed has been found as a contaminant in seed of Siratro and stylo (Friend 1983).\n\nImpacts on biodiversity in native vegetation can occur where Knotweed has invaded open eucalypt forest and rainforests. In these situations, Knobweed usually invades in openings, e.g., along tracks and edges of forest or after disturbance (Smith 2002; Kodela 2008 pers. comm.)",

However, cases of St Peter's Wort poisoning have not been recorded in Australia (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nAgriculture: It is capable of forming dense populations especially on the banks of water courses and may encroach into moist pasture and grassland (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is not yet as extensively naturalised or as aggressive as the related Tutsan (Hypericum androsaemum) and St John's Wort, although, without management has the potential to become more problematic (Muyt 2002). Whilst unlikely to establish in regularly cultivated areas, it has demonstrated a capacity to invade pasture in southern Tasmania. Whilst this effect is likely to be limited to poorly maintained pastures, the consequence of land owners failing to control the plant would include a larger source of seed for potential distribution to natural areas.\n\nNative ecosystems: St Peter's Wort is not commonly described as invasive in natural environments but may displace native riparian species in disturbed situations.

    "impact": "St John's Wort was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, St John's Wort was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: St John's Wort contains hypericin, a photodynamic compound that reacts to light, causing photosensitization (i.e. skin irritation). Hypericin also has negative effects on animal behaviour and organ function. Although St John's Wort is usually avoided by grazing animals, they will consume it when other feed is scarce. Ingestion can cause weight loss, failure to gain weight, reduced wool and milk production, and reduced reproductive performance. Some livestock will die because of grazing St John's Wort (Bourke 1997). Horses are more susceptible than other forms of livestock. For a detailed discussion on the effects of St John's Wort on animal health, see Bourke (1997).\n\nIn pastures, St John's Wort displaces useful vegetation (Campbell et al. 1995) and, if left to establish, can eliminate almost all other plants. Large and dense infestations have led to the abandonment of formerly productive areas in north-eastern Victoria and in New South Wales. It is not as problematic on arable land as continued cultivation does not allow for conditions conducive to invasion of the weed (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: In summer, the masses of dry stems that are left standing can become a fire hazard (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). St John's Wort also invades native habitats. In these situations, its impacts are largely unknown, although it is assumed that the species would have a significant impact on native flora and fauna (Cullen et al. 1997).\n\nHuman impacts: Preparations containing St John's Wort are used medicinally, although these can affect the way some prescription medicines work.

    "impact": "Coolatai Grass is a highly successful and invasive introduced species. It germinates and grows in a wide range of temperatures, produces vast quantities of seed and persists under heavy grazing. Coolatai grass (Hyparrhenia hirta) is an invasive drought, fire and herbicide tolerant tussock forming perennial grass. It has become a major invasive species in northern New South Wales (NSW) and southern Queensland, dominating pastures over a range of soil types and conditions. It is also one of the few perennial grasses capable of invading undisturbed natural ecosystems and is a major threat to natural biodiversity in stock routes, nature reserves and National Parks. Pasture dominated by Coolatai Grass can be productive, although the management requirements are higher than that commonly employed (DPI NSW 2019).\n\nAgriculture: It impacts on grazing by dominating paddocks which are not intensively grazed or managed and although stock will graze fresh leaf growth they avoid older growth. Selective grazing by stock of more palatable grasses assists Coolatai Grass to become dominant in pastures (McCormick & Lodge 1991; Lodge & McCormick 1995; Lodge et al. 2005). DPI NSW (2019) state the following: Coolatai Grass readily invades pastures and dominates them, particularly where ground cover is low (less than 70%) due to the grazing regime (set stocking) and low soil fertility. Failure to appropriately manage a Coolatai grass dominated pasture will see a monoculture of tall rank growth of low digestibility (<40%) and protein (<7%). Sheep production will be poor and cattle will need supplementary nitrogen or protein to be able to utilise the feed. Most graziers feel that if you don’t already have Coolatai grass you don’t want it as there are more easily managed perennial and annual pasture options available. On the other hand, studies have shown that with significant management inputs where Coolatai grass is kept short, it can be a highly productive pasture and meet the feed requirement of dry stock. Coolatai grass also has the benefit of not having damaging seeds like wiregrasses (Aristida spp.) and corkscrew grass (Austrostipa spp.), however there are other more easily managed tropical perennial pasture species available that also have benign seed. If large areas have been dominated by Coolatai Grass, management strategies of rotational grazing, spring burning and/or slashing will be essential. The maintenance of a legume component in a Coolatai Grass dominated pasture is difficult.\n\nNative ecosystems: Coolatai grass poses a huge risk to the biodiversity of the fragmented areas of native ecosystems remaining  as it easily invades relatively undisturbed ecosystems being only one of few grasses to invade a wide range of intact native variegation. Coolatai Grass impacts on biodiversity by out competing and replacing native plants, preventing their regeneration and reducing available fauna habitat. It creates a fire hazard by producing large amounts of dry material resulting in a large fuel load (AMLR NRM undated). In a survey carried out in Kwiambal National Park, New South Wales the total number of species and number of native species was considerably lower in plots heavily infested with Coolatai Grass compared with plots relatively uninfested with the grass (McArdle et al. 2004). In regions where Coolatai Grass is widespread, sites of high biodiversity value should be a priority for control measures (CRC 2007).\n\nAreas of linear remnant vegetation such as road side reserves and railway lines are particularly prone to infestation due to their long edge to area ratio and their proximity the moving traffic (McArdle et al. 2004). Remnant grassy box woodlands in southern Australia are being threatened by the invasion of Coolatai Grass (CRC 2007). Indirectly, invasion of Coolatai Grass changes the nutrient and water cycle, and alters fire regimes (McArdle et al. 2004).\n\nUrban areas: Also invades areas in and around towns, on urban fringes, roadsides and other transport corridors, colonising bare and degraded areas, lawns and disturbed sites.",

    "impact": "Hymenachne is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS) and is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, economic and environmental impacts. Since escaping from cultivation in recent years it has seriously threatened the wetlands of northern Australia. Hymenachne invades permanent water bodies and seasonally inundated wetlands. It blocks waterways, potentially causing flooding, threatening drinking water and also blocks drainage and irrigation channels in cropping areas (CRC 2003).\n\nThe environmental threats posed to wetlands are severe, as Hymenachne forms dense stands that displace native water plant species. By forming floating mats, these stands also reduce available habitat for native animals (Wearne et al. 2010). Compared to native vegetation, Hymenachne stands exhibit lower species diversity of plants and of many groups of insects, whereas introduced fish are more abundant (Houston & Duivemvoorden 2002).\n\nIn the Northern Territory, infestations have been found in important conservation areas including the Mary River and Kakadu National Parks, and at Murganella on the Cobourg Peninsula. The potential exists for Hymenachne to severely detract from the high conservation and tourism value of such natural wetland systems in northern Australia. The potential loss of natural wildlife resources (such as fish and waterfowl) to indigenous people is an impact that has social, environmental and economic consequences. It also has the potential to cause severe impacts on the sugar cane industry, by reducing the quality of crops and infesting drainage and irrigation channels. In one reported case, an infestation in a cane crop caused a 50% reduction in the price of the sugar (CRC 2003).",

It can clog rivers, choke channels and also reduce the holding capacity of storage ponds and dams, leading to the loss of urban and agricultural water supplies (Swarbrick et al. 1995; Holm et al. 1997; Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Balciunas et al. 2002; Stephens & Dowling 2002; Global Invasive Species Database 2006).\n\nDense stands can alter water quality by decreasing oxygen levels and increasing pH and water temperature (Global Invasive Species Database 2006).\n\nDense colonies of Hydrilla reduce sport fishing by reducing the open-water feeding and spawning areas for fish. It also affects the recreational use and tourism potential of waterways as dense masses clog waterways and impede boat passage (Cronk & Fennessy 2001).\n\nHydrilla can be invasive and impact on other native biodiversity. It can form a dense canopy at the water's surface that shades growth in the water column below, while large mats crowd out other aquatic plants and reduce habit for wildlife (Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Sainty & Jacobs 2003; Weber 2003). Single species stands of Hydrilla may occur due to plants releasing allelopathic substances, chemicals that inhibit the growth of other plant species (Gopal & Goel 1993; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).",

    "origin": "It is uncertain where Hydrilla is truly native (Cook & Lüönd 1982), but it is generally considered to be a cosmopolitan species with an original distribution from parts of Europe to Africa, India, south-east Asia and Australia (Swarbrick et al. 1995; Cowie et al. 2000; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; PIER 2008).",

    "impact": "Buchan Weed (Hirschfeldia incana) is a weed of open, disturbed habitats in natural, anthropogenic, and agricultural systems, mostly impacting agricultural Pasture and cropping but also a weed of orchards and vineyards. It is a  weed of disturbed urban areas such as roadsides, rail corridors, fence lines,  gardens and parks in the suburbs, yards and abandoned sites, and some disturbed natural environments.\n\nAgriculture: Buchan Weed is one of the crucifer (Brassicaceae) weeds that compete with broadacre crops and pasture in some situations. Buchan weed populations increase when broad-leaf crops, such as oilseed rape and vegetable seed are grown. In pastures it may be present but not obvious due to grazing. When these pastures are cultivated it may dominate unless controlled by grazing, cultivation or herbicides (Government of South Australia 2014). Buchan weed does not normally invade healthy pastures invading poor pastures and if eaten by stock, can taint meat and dairy products (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is normally only palatable when young, loosing palatability when flowering and fruiting. It can grow in dense stands replacing and limiting desirable species, and the amount of pasture available. It can sometimes be a serious competitor when growing amongst winter cereals, reducing yields as well as interfering with harvesting and contaminating harvested grain (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Also a weed forming dense stands in orchards and vineyards. It has the potential to become a major cropping weed in Victoria (Dellow et al. 2006)a and is regarded as one of the top nine Brassica weeds in South Australia (Dellow et al. 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: As Buchan Weed is  a weed of disturbed sites it does not normally invade intact native vegetation. However, it can invade disturbed open vegetation, examples being; creek-lines; grassy woodlands, open coastal dense; and especially on margins and tracks of  other native variegation types in agricultural areas where the weed is common.\n\nUrban areas: Invades roadsides, rail corridors, disturbed areas and parks.",

Giant Hogweed acts as a host for some crop pests and diseases.\n\nNative ecosystems:  In Europe, Giant Hogweed has negative impacts on biodiversity and the environment in general, Giant Hogweed is an aggressive competitor, which is able to out-compete native plant species, reducing the amount of suitable habitat available for insects, birds and mammals (EPPO 2006). When it dies back during the winter months, it leaves bare ground. This can lead to an increase in soil erosion on riverbanks and steep slopes (Davies 2008).\n\nUrban areas: Known to grow on urban fringes and in urban riparian areas Giant Hogweed is toxic to humans, the sap can cause severe photo-sensitivity of the skin, impacting human health, native flora and tourism (EPPO 2006). It contains a substance within its sap that makes the skin sensitive to ultraviolet light. This can result in severe burns to the affected areas, producing swelling and severe, painful blistering (Davies 2008). In other areas of the world dense infestations of the weed can lower the recreational value of the landscape and seriously interfere with access to amenity areas and river banks.

    "impact": "Native ecosystems: English Ivy is an aggressive invader that threatens all vegetation levels of forested and open areas, growing along the ground as well as into the forest canopy. It excludes the native vegetation and results in a loss of biodiversity. The dense growth and abundant leaves, which spring from the stems like small umbrellas, form a thick canopy just above the ground and prevent sunlight from reaching other plants. Vines climbing up tree trunks spread, surround and cover branches and twigs, preventing most of the sunlight from reaching the leaves of the host tree thus reducing photosynthesis. It covers growing tips, and thus disrupts the tree's growth, first on branch tips and eventually at the tree top. The impacts on photosynthesis and growth may also result in damage to the root system, since the tree can no longer provide the necessary level of nutrition to the roots. Loss of host tree vigour, evident within a few years, is followed by death a few years later. The added weight of vines makes infested trees susceptible to blow-over during storms (DPI 2004; GISD 2005; Swearingen & Diedrich 2006).\n\nHuman impacts: It also has poisonous foliage and its flower pollen can irritate eyes. The leaves and berries of English Ivy contain the glycoside hederin which could cause toxicosis if ingested. As symptoms can include gastrointestinal upset and diarrhoea this feature may aid effective dispersal by birds, ensuring consumed seeds pass quickly through their digestive systems (DPI 2004; GISD 2005; Swearingen & Diedrich 2006).",

Incursions have been discovered 2 ½ km into undisturbed rainforest, in small gaps created by tree falls and landslips (Anon. 1995).\n\nAlthough the current incursions are mostly restricted to the Babinda region, there is a potential for the species to increase its range to other areas with favourable climate and rainfall in tropical Australia (Natural Resources and Water Queensland 2005b). One of the reasons for this is its broad elevation tolerance in its natural range in Africa, which varies from sea level to 1800 metres. There are fears that over the next 20–30 years the species may invade the higher peaks of the Wooroonooran National Park. It has the possibility of becoming a permanent component of tropical rainforests (Csurhes & Edwards 1998) with the majority of the wet tropics at risk of invasion (Vitelli & van Haaren 2001).",

It is also poisonous to livestock and humans and has caused deaths in cattle, sheep and poultry. It is seldom consumed fresh by livestock, but may be dangerous if it contaminates fodder or chaff. Severe gastroenteritis is the main symptom of poisoning by this species. Contact with the sap can also cause skin rashes and other symptoms in humans (Lloyd & Peirce 2003).\n\nNarrow Leaf Cotton Bush is also regarded as an environmental weed in Western Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland (WWF 2006). It is a common weed of grasslands, open woodlands and disturbed sites and also invades riparian areas. It competes with native plants in these habitats and is capable of forming dense thickets. Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush is currently of utmost concern as an environmental weed in New South Wales and Western Australia, where it often invades conservation areas. For example, Narrow Leaf Cotton Bush was recently listed as a moderately important species in the Environmental Weed Strategy of Western Australia and was also listed among the top 20 priority environmental weed species in the Namoi Catchment, in the inland parts of northern New South Wales.

It has been suggested that some deaths of native birds and animals have been caused by ingestion of the seeds (Maroochy Shire Council undated).\n\nHuman impacts: The plant contains colchicine alkaloids and has been recorded as a cause of poisoning in humans. The rootstock is believed to be more toxic than other parts of the plant. In parts of India it is used under strict preparation guidelines in Ayurvedic medicine, and it is grown commercially for colchicine production. It is reported to have allelopathic effects (toxicity from a plant that inhibits the growth of other plants), interfering with the establishment and growth of associated species (Everist 1981; Oudhia 2003; NSW Agriculture 2005).",

Following an assessment process, Honey Locust was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: Honey Locust is an aggressive exotic tree. Although beneficial in the short-term as stock feed, the long-term consequences of its growth and spread are counter-productive. If not controlled, Honey Locust can destroy pastures by smothering the more desirable grass species. The plant can form dense thickets, particularly along waterways, preventing stock access to water (Land Protection 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: Honey Locust is an invasive tree capable of out-competing and replacing native vegetation. It can often create dense monocultures and hence provide restricted habitat for native fauna. The sharp barbs on its branches can also injure wildlife. These monocultures can also provide a haven for introduced pest animals such as foxes, cats and rabbits (Land Protection 2006).\n\nHuman impacts: The plant's long, strong spines can inflict serious injuries and infections to humans and livestock. They can also cause damage to vehicle tyres, restricting vehicle movement near infestations. Even when the plant has died, spines can continue to inflict injury (Land Protection 2006).",

    "impact": "Cape Broom (Genista monspessulana) is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in temperate Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. Approximately 600,000 ha or more of national, state and urban parks, and fallow land are already infested with Cape Broom (Sheppard & Henry 2012). Cape Broom grows quickly, produces large amounts of long-lived seed, and can tolerate diverse environmental conditions. Being a leguminous shrub, it fixes nitrogen and consequently increases soil fertility providing a favourable habitat for re-generation and germination of more Cape Broom and other introduced weeds. Cape Broom establishes a large long-lived seed-bank making it difficult to eradicate (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Muyt 2001; Department of Primary Industries Victoria 2004).\n\nAgriculture: Cape Broom forms dense thickets which exclude most other vegetation. Dense infestations in pastures reduce carrying capacity of grazing land, provide harbour for rabbits and foxes. Cape Broom is considered toxic to stock if grazed excessively, but in Australia no cases of poisoning have been reported. Forestry impacts – Cape Broom is a weeds of major concern to foresters as they grow quickly and out-compete native and plantation species (Office of Environment and Heritage 2014).\n\nNative ecosystems:  Cape Broom forms dense thickets which exclude most other vegetation increasing fire fuel-loads, changing vegetation structure. It out-competes indigenous plants and discourages their regeneration by shading under-storey species and by using nitrogen fixation to increase soil fertility, increasing soil erosion by excluding grasses and ground-covers thereby increasing the amount of bare ground underneath (Office of Environment and Heritage 2014). Fires and soil disturbance in infested areas usually lead to mass germination of soil-stored seed. In some areas of remnant bushland Cape Broom is sufficiently established to be assumed to be an indigenous plant and is retained in the belief it is part of the natural environment.\n\nUrban areas: Readily invades disturbed areas such as roadsides, fence-lines, and abandoned or uncared for land. The infestation of abandoned grazing paddocks on the peri-urban fringe by Cape Broom thickets is also a fire hazard that increases the risk of bushfires moving into residential suburbs.",

    "impact": "Flax-leaf Broom (Genista linifolia) is a Weed of National Significance (WoNS), is regarded as an environmental weed, and is seen as posing a very high threat to numerous native vegetation communities as well as being a problem for agriculture (Carr et al. 1992; Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Csurhes & Edwards 1998).\n\nAgriculture: Flax-leaf Broom is believed to be toxic but is rarely grazed and as such isn’t perceived as being a problem. However, it can from dense clumps which reduce grazing area (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nNative ecosystems:  The dense clumps and hedge rows formed by Flax-leaf Broom exclude native vegetation and can provide habitat for feral animals (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Csurhes & Edwards 1998). It out-competes native plants by using nitrogen fixation to increase soil fertility. Furthermore, Flax-leaf Broom is also considered a serious fire hazard (Office of Environment and Heritage 2014) and is able to recover quickly after disturbances such as fire (Australian Weeds Committee 2011).  It is a weed of disturbed areas such as roadsides but it also invade a range of woodland and forest types, damp sclerophyll forest, grassy woodland, lowland grassland, coastal shrubland, and riparian vegetation, (Carr et al. 1992). Flax-leaf Broom readily colonises coastal areas and in southern Australia it invades sand dunes (Office of Environment and Heritage 2014).\n\nUrban areas:  Readily invades disturbed areas such as roadsides, rail embankments, fence-lines, and abandoned grazing paddocks or uncared for land.",

It is drought and salt tolerant, a weed of highly disturbed sites (e.g. mine sites), waste areas, coastal environments, roadsides, parks, footpaths and lawns (Queensland Government 2016).\n\nAgriculture: Bees that collect the nectar of Galenia produce honey with such a disagreeable flavour that is unsaleable. Galenia  invades pastures and disturbed areas, and is known to produce nitrates that can be toxic to stock. (DPI NSW 2019), but is generally found in areas where over-grazing has occurred (Queensland Government 2016). However, although the research shows that Galenia contains levels of nitrates and soluble oxalates that can be toxic to stock, on infertile soils these chemical were not found to be in high levels, but plants grown in fertile soils accumulated the chemicals in toxic amounts (Williams 1979).\n\nNative ecosystems: It aggressively invades coastal dunes, disturbed open vegetation, roadside vegetation, and rocky outcrop vegetation.  In Victoria, Galenia is recorded as invading dry coastal vegetation, low grasslands, grassy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and rock outcrop vegetation (Carr et al. 1992). Rocky chenopod open-scrub is reported as being invaded by Galenia. In South Australia at the Bolivar Treatment Works this species forms a dominant understorey mat in degraded woodland sites to the exclusion of other native ground flora. It is recorded as preventing the regeneration of seedlings in an endangered population of River Red Gum in the Hunter Catchment.\n\nUrban areas: Invades any disturbed areas like roadsides, parks, footpaths and lawns.",

Plants are unpalatable and have no feed value, but are eaten when little other feed is available (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992).\n\nAgriculture: Snakecotton has been identified as having a potential financial risk impact on all forms of grazing land use (Cunningham et al. 2003). Climate analyses and comparison of overseas occurrence indicate Snakecotton is more likely to establish in drier parts of central Queensland and northern New South Wales. Dryland grazing and cropping landuses are most at risk from spread of this species into its potential climate range (FAO 2006; Cunningham & Brown 2006).\n\nNative ecosystems: Little information is currently available on the potential environmental impacts or impacts on biodiversity of snake cotton.

Examination of collections from the United States indicates the range of Snakecotton has expanded substantially since 1900. This is most likely due to both natural exploitation of open habitats and unintentional human introductions (McCauley & Ballard 2002). It has been classified as a weed in Nebraska and the Great Plains (Stubbendieck et al. 1994). Snakecotton is also recorded as occurring in the West Indies (USDA 2007).",

It also is a weed of roadsides, railways, stream banks, alluvial flats, irrigation channels, gardens, refuse sites and disturbed areas, particularly in suburban areas. Strongly smelling of aniseed, some people consider the plant to have an offensive or even nauseating smell. Fennel is able to successfully compete with other vegetation once it is established, and may form dense stand excluding all other vegetation.\n\nAgriculture: Commonly occurs in agricultural areas. Although not always considered palatable by animals, sheep and cattle may graze young plants, fennel can invade agricultural areas, particularly degraded pastures, with Queensland Government (2016) documenting it as palatable to livestock and is generally not seen as a major problem in these areas. However, Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001) comment toxicity problems in grazing animals are generally not encountered but deaths of both sheep and cattle have previously occurred after eating residues from distillation of commercially grown fennel plants. The grazing of Fennel stubbles do not appear to be toxic and it is rarely if ever a problem in field situations.\n\nNative ecosystems: Impacts on vegetation found along road, rail and water ways potentially preventing native plant species from establishing or shading out existing plants. This could be of great significance in farming areas when remnant vegetation is often restricted to road and rail verges. Found in open woodland  especially along tracks and paths and the edges, and in open areas especially grasslands.\n\nUrban areas: A weed of urban areas, colonises gardens, abandoned and little carried for sites. Dense infestations along waterways may restrict some recreational activities (Muyt 2001).",

Following an assessment process, Sea Spurge was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national signficance.\n\nNative ecosystems: Sea Spurge is regarded as a significant environmental weed throughout the coastal districts of southern Australia. It has successfully invaded many open coastal communities, quickly establishing large and dense infestations (Navie and Adkins 2007). Populations of this species may reach tens of thousands where beaches are free of other vegetation or have a low level of plant cover. It can also rapidly colonise eroded areas, such as blowouts (depressions in dunes caused by wind blowing the sand away), often becoming the dominant plant species.\n\nSea Spurge initially colonises the foredunes at the back of the beach. These infestations tend to stabilise the dunes, preventing natural sand movement inland, and creating a different dune structure to that created by native species (Rudman 2003). This can also decrease the availability of beach nesting sites for shore birds, and may be contributing to their decline in some areas. For example, the endangered Hooded Plover (Thinornis rubricollis) uses un-vegetated sand areas on beaches for nesting sites (Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania 2003). If uncontrolled, Sea Spurge can then spread inland from these areas, displacing native vegetation and invading adjacent grassland communities. In New South Wales, Sea Spurge is thought to threaten the survival of endangered native coastal plants, such as Chamaesyce psammogeton (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nHuman impacts: Sea Spurge is poisonous to humans and the milky sap in its stems can be highly irritating when it comes into contact with the skin or when it is accidentally rubbed into the eyes (Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania 2003).",

It is usually associated with disturbed habitats but can also establish in undisturbed bush (Muyt 2001). It has the potential to actively invade and expand within native vegetation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area and adjacent areas, and in doing so, alter the natural ecology of the area (Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service 2004).

Following an assessment process, African Lovegrass was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: African Lovegrass spreads from roadsides and disturbed sites into neighbouring degraded and poorly managed and overgrazed or poor quality pastures. It is very competitive with other pasture species and quickly overtakes, particularly in sandy soils. It is not normally eaten by livestock when mature, and this increases the competition on more preferable pasture species. African Love grass also has a low nutritional value, thereby decreasing pasture productivity (Navie & Adkins 2007). It can also invade vineyards, horticultural crops and orchards.\n\nNative ecosystems: This species is also regarded as a major environmental weed and currently causes significant problems in Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. During a recent survey it was listed as a priority environmental weed in ten of Australia's Natural Resource Management regions (CRC 2006). African Lovegrass is an early coloniser of disturbed sites, grows rapidly, and can form dense stands which crowd out and replace native species, also preventing their regeneration (Navie & Adkins 2007). In New South Wales it is a particularly serious weed of remnant native grassy vegetation in farming areas, and can transform these threatened communities by modifying their composition, structure and processes. For example, it is seen as a threat to natural temperate grasslands throughout the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. African Lovegrass is also one of a group of exotic perennial grasses that have been listed as being a \"key threatening process\" in New South Wales. In Victoria it has also invaded heathlands, woodlands and grasslands and in south-eastern Queensland it is ranked among the top 50 most invasive plant species (Navie & Adkins 2007). African Lovegrass invasions also pose a threat to the survival of individual threatened species such as the endangered Narrow-petalled Featherflower (Verticordia plumosa var. pleiobotrya) in south-western Western Australia and locally threatened populations of the Pine Donkey Orchid (Diuris tricolor) in the Muswellbrook area in central New South Wales. Because it produces higher fuel loads than native vegetation and is highly flammable, particularly during the dry season, dense infestations can also increase the intensities of bushfires. This has negative impacts for more fire-prone native species and increases the fire hazard to people and property (Navie & Adkins 2007).\n\nUrban environments:  Grows and invades roadsides and little managed and degraded urban areas.",

Although only in the early stages of establishment, Horsetails have the potential to seriously degrade Australia's ecosystems (CRC 2003). Horsetails are highly invasive, difficult to control and toxic to livestock. They can be allelopathic.\n\nNative ecosystems: Horsetails are known as one of the world's worst weeds and are highly invasive. In Sydney they have infested hundreds of square metres along creek lines. They have the potential to become persistent weeds of wetlands and other low-lying areas. Large areas of natural vegetation are potentially under threat (CRC 2003).\n\nAgriculture: Horsetails are highly toxic to livestock. If consumed in contaminated hay it has been known to kill horses, cattle and sheep (CRC 2003). Most Equisetum species contain poisonous glycosides in the rhizomes and aerial shoots. Equisetum arvense also contains alkaloids that make it toxic to horses, causing a syndrome (equisetosis) that is sometimes fatal.Part of its action may be due to the enzyme thiaminase that destroys thiamine (vitamin B1) in the stomach of the animal.It has also caused losses in sheep and cattle and is reputed to taint milk when eaten in quantity (Government of South Australia 2021). In high densities, Horsetails reduce crop yields by producing inhibitory substances that depress the growth of neighbouring plants (CRC 2003). Equisetum species are also competitive and persistent weeds of crops and pastures in the Northern Hemisphere. Horsetails are of particular concern to the canola, cereals, lupin, apple and pear, and potato growing industries and as a nursery weed (Groves et al. 2005).",

    "impact": "Lesser Jack is a relatively weak competitor but has several strong colonizing characteristics including drought tolerance, rapid growth, abundant seed production, seed dormancy and high dispersal abilities and the two types of achene give the plant its invasive properties. Rapidly produced large subterranean achenes maximise the progeny's fitness/competitiveness whilst numerous (>1000/plant) small spiny aerial achenes maximise the colonizing characteristics of the species. The seeds have the potential to remain viable for many years within the soil enabling the species to persist through long periods of unfavourable conditions (CABI 2021).\n\nAgriculture: Lesser Jack is a weed of pasture and cultivation, and the spiny fruit can cause lameness in stock. Because it grows taller than Spiny Emex, it is more of a problem in cereal crops than that species (Scott et al. 1996; Wilson 2007). The grain industry (cereals, pulses and oilseeds) has restrictions on the maximum allowable levels of contamination with Rumex seed, from 0 (zero) Rumex seed/500 ml in malt barley in South Australia to 20 Rumex seed/500 ml in feed barley or lupins in Western Australia. In wheat, 8 Rumex seed/500 ml is the national maximum standard (Bowran, 1996). Lesser Jack, with its erect growth habit and a seed size similar to grain makes it potentially a far larger problem to the Australian grain-growing industry than the currently widespread Spiny Emex (CABI 2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Lesser Jack has the potential to invade in disturbed areas  as a weed in national parks and nature reserves, and marginal sites such as roads, tracks, firebreaks, picnic areas, old homesteads and clearings. It could also impact on biodiversity and the environment by invading natural areas such as the edges of creeks, riverine flats, alluvial flats (claypans, edges of saline lakes) and rocky areas.\n\nUrban areas: The spiny fruits impact and restrict the use of recreation areas recreational areas, especially where people are bare-footed and spines can penetrate light footwear, and could impact bike riders, puncturing  bicycles tyres (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; VicFora 2016).",

    "impact": "Spiny emex (Rumex hypogaeus) is a common weed of agricultural areas, particularly crops, and disturbed habitats (e.g. roadsides, tracks, firebreaks, picnic sites, old homesteads and clearings). However, it is often present in highly disturbed sites in conservation reserves and also invades natural areas including creekbanks, river floodplains, claypans, the edges of saline lakes and granite rock areas. It is a serious weed of crops and pastures.\n\nAgriculture: Spiny Emex is a weed of pasture and cultivation. It can reduce crop yields (particularly cereals) and pasture productivity by competition, as it is fast growing and the prostrate growth smothers more desirable species such as legumes. Infestations of spiny emex can be very dense and counts of more than 900 plants per square metre have been made in Western Australia. South Australian studies show that an infestation of about 11 plants per square metre reduces wheat yields by almost 40% (Agriculture Victoria 2021).  Major impact on quantity of produce It is also a serious weed of dried grapes, as the spiny fruit can become mixed with grapes on drying racks and they are difficult to grade out (Chorney 1986; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty and Associates 2005; Land Protection 2006).  Spiny emex contains oxalates in the leaves which are toxic to ruminants especially sheep (DPI NSW 20219). Stock rarely eat Spiny Emex, but it has been suspected of stock poisoning on some occasions. The plant can contain potentially toxic levels of oxalates at levels that are sufficiently high to poison sheep or cattle if the animals were forced to eat large amounts when very hungry (Everist 1974; Stanley & Ross 1983; Cunningham et al. 1992; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). The sharp-pointed fruits are troublesome to animals such as dogs and sheep, and the spiny fruits can cause lameness. Sheep have developed blackleg from infection of wounds to the feet caused by the spiny fruits.\n\nNative ecosystems: Spiny Emex also occurs as a weed in national parks and nature reserves, usually in disturbed sites such as roads, tracks, firebreaks, picnic areas, old homesteads and clearings. However, it can also impact on biodiversity and the environment by invading natural areas such as the edges of creeks, riverine flats, alluvial flats (claypans, edges of saline lakes) and rocky areas (Keighery 1996).\n\nUrban areas: The Spiny fruits can also puncture small tyres, such as those of bicycles, and restrict the use of recreation areas, particularly where people are bare-footed and spines can penetrate light footwear (Cunningham et al. 1992; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Sainty and Associates 2005; VicFora 2016).",

    "impact": "Native ecosystems: Dense infestations of Elodea can reduce water flow by as much as 60–80% and, in reservoirs, interfere with hydroelectric output, making it is one of several water weeds that can cause commercial losses to hydropower stations and urban water supplies in New Zealand. On rivers, lakes and other waterbodies, dense tangled mats disrupt waterway traffic and navigation, limit recreational use by impeding activities such as boating, swimming and fishing and significantly alter the aquatic environment (Holm et al. 1997; Thorp & Wilson 1998; Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nWhen Elodea invades lakes, streams and wetlands, it can reduce the abundance of native aquatic plants or replace species as its dense closed stands out-compete or greatly impede the growth of native aquatic plants. Aquatic environments and habitats will be altered by heavy infestations, with potential impacts on wildlife (Cronk & Fennessy 2001; Weber 2003). Light intensity, temperature, oxygen content and pH of the water are reduced which affects the solubility of dissolved salts, the nutrient status of the water and, as a result, fish numbers (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Elodea has also invaded constructed wetlands (Gunasekera 2003) and shows a higher dispersal capacity via fragmentation than its weedy relatives Egeria densa and Lagarosiphon major (Redekop et al. 2016).\n\nAgriculture: Elodea is an obstructive and persistent aquatic weed of irrigation supply and drainage channels. Its spread in irrigation systems can threaten irrigated agriculture by greatly reducing water flow and sometimes by causing channels to overflow (Aston 1973; Mitchell 1978; Bowmer et al. 1979, 1984, 1995; Sainty & Jacobs 1981, 2003; Holm et al. 1997; Flanagan 1998; Richardson et al. 2006).",

It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nWater Hyacinth is declared as a noxious plant in all states and territories and is on the World Conservation Union’s list of the world’s 100 worst invasive alien species (ISSG 2000). It is a highly invasive aquatic plant that has become a pest of waterways around the world. It grows aggressively in nutrient-rich stationary or slow-moving freshwater to quickly form dense mats. A single plant has been known to develop in one season into a patch covering about 600 square metres (Aston 1973).\n\nThese mats rapidly degrade environments in various ways. They block and choke waterbodies, obstructing water flows in natural watercourses, natural and constructed lakes and ponds, irrigation and flood mitigation channels, and reservoirs and dams. This in turn interferes with and reduces boating, fishing, swimming and other water recreational activities. They can block water pumps, inlets of boat engine water cooling systems and other equipment, and have the potential to interfere with hydro-electric generators. Masses can build-up at bridges, fences and other structures especially during floods, creating a dam and endangering the structure (Sainty & Jacobs 2003).\n\nInfestations reduce water quality as rotting vegetation reduces the oxygen content and fouls the water, impacting on native plants and animals and making water unfit for drinking by humans and livestock. Biodiversity will decline as dense mats reduce light levels, temperature and oxygen in the water below, excluding native aquatic plant species, and altering or destroying natural wetlands and habitat for native invertebrates, amphibians, fish and birds.\n\nIncreased loss of water through transpiration (Sainty & Jacobs 1981) has impacts on water storage and supply.\n\nWater Hyacinth infestations can limit access by stock and wildlife to water, and are a potential hazard to young children and livestock if they become entangled in dense vegetation. It can provide shelter for mosquitoes and other disease-spreading organisms (Sainty & Jacobs 2003). Dense mats may be colonised by other plant species and greatly accelerate freshwater succession (Weber 2003), aging a wetland.\n\nSome of the uses of Water Hyacinth are described by Saint & Jacobs (1981) and Parsons & Cuthbertson (2001).",

Following an assessment process, Paterson's Curse was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: Paterson's Curse can form very extensive, dense, persistent populations in disturbed areas. It is a very competitive and dominant species, especially in areas where grazing pressure is low and soil fertility is high (Piggin & Sheppard 1995). Its high early growth rate, stout taproot and large smothering rosette leaves enable it to compete vigorously with seedlings of native and useful pasture species (Muyt 2001; Weber 2003). Early germination, coupled with a fast-growing root system, contribute to the competitive success of this species (Piggin & Sheppard 1995). Significant drought resistance of seedlings explains why Paterson's Curse is abundant in years when summer rainfalls are followed by periods of drought (Piggin & Sheppard 1995).\n\nNative ecosystems: In Victoria, it is considered a potential threat to two plant species listed under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988: Diuris dendrobioides [as Diuris cuneata] (Wedge Diuris) and (Cullen parvum) [as Psoralea parva] (Small Psoralea) (Adair & Groves 1998).\n\nIt is sometimes considered a useful fodder species, especially the young growth which is readily eaten by stock, particularly sheep (DPIW 2002). However, it contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that can be toxic to livestock. Consumption of the plant can result in chronic liver damage and mortality, especially if substantial amounts are eaten over prolonged periods (Auld & Medd 1987; Piggin & Sheppard 1995). Deaths of animals due to plant toxicity are rare and can be avoided with good pasture and livestock management (Piggin & Sheppard 1995).\n\nHuman and livestock contact with the abrasive hairs on the plant can cause dermatitis, itching and inflammation (Auld & Medd 1987; Piggin & Sheppard 1995). It can also trigger hayfever (Naughton et al. 2006). Nationwide it has been estimated that 33 million ha of land is infested with Paterson's Curse (Faithfull & McLaren 2004) and that the total cost of Paterson's Curse to Australia's sheep and cattle producers is estimated at $250 million per year (DSE 2004).",

It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nNative ecosystems: Cat's Claw Creeper has the ability to completely smother native vegetation, even growing up over tall trees, and many bushland areas in eastern Australia have serious infestations of this species (Land Protection 2006). It can grow as a ground cover along the forest floor of scrub remnants and form a thick carpet of stems and leaves which chokes out small existing plants and prevents the germination of all other species. The large climbing stems can also reach to the top of the rainforest canopy where, through a combination of weight and shading, they can cause the eventual death of the largest canopy trees (McClymont 1996). The vigorous and extensive root system, which produces large tubers at about 50 cm intervals, also adds to the difficulty of controlling this weed (McClymont 1996; Land Protection 2006). Cat's Claw Creeper is particularly aggressive in riparian vegetation in south-eastern Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales, but is also a potential threat to riparian and rainforest plant communities throughout the sub-tropical and tropical zones of eastern and northern Australia (Csurhes & Edwards 1998). It was recently ranked as the fourth most invasive alien plant species in south-eastern Queensland (Batianoff & Butler 2002), and is currently regarded as a priority environmental weed in five Natural Resource Management regions.",

Historically, the species was mainly a weed of agricultural areas, but it is also regarded as an environmental weed in some areas invading conservation areas. Stinkwort exudes a strong-smelling oil from glands on most parts of the plant. This causes allergic contact dermatitis in some people.\n\nAgriculture: Although reported as toxic and poisonous to livestock, little evidence exists that it is toxic, although oxalate poisoning has been reported when it is grazed, and fishermen in southern Italy reportedly use the macerated leaves to stun fish. Grazing animals appear to find Stinkwort fairly unpalatable, eating the plant only when it is very young, when little else is available. The oil also taints meat and milk of animals forced to graze the plant (Mitchell & Rook 1979; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Flora of North America undated). Discolours wool but it comes out during scouring.\n\nNative ecosystems: While Stinkwort is mainly a weed of agricultural land and highly disturbed sites, it is also rated a potential threat to dry coastal vegetation, mallee shrubland, lowland grassland and grassy woodland, and dry sclerophyll forest and woodland (Carr et al. 1992). It primarily occurs on land subjected to grazing or other disturbance (e.g. roadsides), but also grows along waterways (i.e. in riparian zones), in wetlands and in coastal habitats (Queensland Government 2016).\n\nUrban areas: A weed of roadsides and waste place especially in agricultural and regional areas.",

The deep roots and large rosettes compete with pasture plants for moisture and nutrients as well as for light, while the spines on leaves and stems discourage grazing by livestock (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001).\n\nNative ecosystems: It is a potential threat to native vegetation along streams and in wetlands (Carr et al. 1992). In dense patches, prickles on leaves and stems may cause some discomfort to humans and fauna. Competition with other plants and the prickly nature of Wild Teasel may reduce available food for fauna (Victorian Resources Online 2007).

    "impact": "Cape Ivy is a highly invasive environmental weed. It invades waterways, moist gullies, closed forests and margins, open woodlands, roadsides, waste areas and coastal areas. Also commonly found in gardens and along fences and urban areas parks.\n\nAgriculture: Not a known weed of crops and pastures, although it may be present on field margins, as well as in irrigation canals and drains surrounding these fields. A possible threat to forestry, horticultural crops, and orchards if allowed to establish.\n\nNative ecosystems:  weed capable of smothering and out-competing native vegetation by climbing over shrubs, up tree branches and across ground flora to form loose mats up to 30 cm thick that prevent regeneration of native species (Blood 2001; Muyt 2001). It can kill shrubs and trees, resulting in light gaps and leading to more weed invasion (Blue Mountains City Council Bushcare 2002). It is a very serious threat to native vegetation in scrub on coastal sand dunes, heathland and heathy woodland, dry sclerophyll forest and woodland, damp sclerophyll forest, wet sclerophyll forest, warm temperate rainforest and along streams (Carr et al.1992; National Herbarium of Victoria 2007). There are associated negative impacts on fauna because of habitat degradation and loss of plant species.\n\nStudies in the United States have identified chemicals in Cape Ivy that make it unsuitable food for most fauna, and toxic to mammals, spiders and fish (California Invasive Plant Council undated).\n\nUrban areas:  It can also occur as a weed in disturbed urban situations, such as on fences along railway verges (Reid 2008 pers. comm.).",

Wild Carrot can also taint milk if dairy cows consume large quantities (Dale 1974), and can dominate pastures competing with and replacing desired plants. Hybridisation with the commercial plant can result in poor seed production (Dale 1974). In Japan, Umehara et al. (2005) made hybrids between wild and cultivated carrots and showed that they can produce vigorous hybrid offspring.\n\nNOTE: Wild Carrot is the same species as the commercially grown plant. However, wild and cultivated carrot are labelled as different subspecies.\n\nWild carrot is: Daucus carota spp. carota.\n\nCultivated carrot is: Daucus carota  spp. sativa.\n\nNative ecosystems:  Wild Carrot poses a threat to recovering grasslands, competes with native grasses and herbs for resources as it matures faster and grows larger than many native herbs or grasses. It can also spreads into disturbed natural communities and can also occasionally invade less disturbed native vegetation. In the US it has been observed to germinate readily after fires and can be particularly persistent in soils with high clay content (Eckardt 1987 in Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 2007).\n\nUrban areas:  Can grow on disturbed areas on urban fringes and roadsides.",

    "impact": "English Broom is a Weed of National Significance (WONS). It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nAgriculture: Although seedlings apparently do not readily establish in ‘improved’ pasture, in non-‘improved’ grazing areas, English Broom can prevent grazing, reduce the area available for grazing, and restrict access to water. Mature plants are relatively unpalatable to sheep and cattle, and in the United States the consumption of foliage by horses has resulted in digestive problems. The seeds are considered toxic to stock if eaten excessively (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Hosking et al. 2000; Muyt 2001; DPIW 2002).\n\nNative ecosystems: In Australia English Broom is mainly an environmental weed, and is highly invasive in the cooler, higher rainfall regions. The total area of infested in Australia is estimated currently as being over 200 000 hectares, and it is still spreading. It can have devastating impacts, and totally transforms invaded areas. It forms dense stands, which shade out the ground flora, and roadside infestations can also reduce drivers’ vision and increase road maintenance costs. It commonly establishes in disturbed margins of native vegetation, from where it invades less disturbed native vegetation. Infestations also provide shelter for pest animals such as pigs and horses, which in turn pose a threat to native biota. It has invaded disturbed areas in national parks which have been cleared of blackberry infestations.\n\nEnglish Broom has invaded numerous native vegetation types in all the states where it is naturalised. In South Australia it is a common weed in the Southern Lofty Ranges. The species poses a very high risk to native vegetation, and has invaded heathlands and heathy woodlands, lowland grasslands and grassy woodlands, dry sclerophyll forest, wet sclerophyll forest, and alpine and subalpine areas (Carr et al. 1992). It is considered as one of the major invasive threats to the alpine and subalpine areas. It is abundant in the Mitta Mitta River valley, and around Falls Creek in Victoria. In New South Wales extensive areas of native vegetation have become infested. In the Barrington Tops north of Newcastle, an estimated 10 000 hectares has been invaded, and it is also a serious problem in the Blue Mountains. A number of orchid species and a daisy shrub that occur in the Barrington Tops are at risk from invasion (Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992; Sainty et al. 1998; Hosking et al. 2000; Muyt 2001).",

    "origin": "English Broom is native to western, southern and central Europe, extending northwards to southern Sweden and eastwards to Ukraine (Tutin et al. 1968). It also occurs in the Macaronesia group of islands in the Atlantic (GRIN 2007).",

The burrs of Blue Hound's Tongue can attach to livestock and may cause irritation and taint wool (CRC 2003).\n\nNative ecosystems: The severe impacts recorded overseas by the related species, Hound's Tongue (Cynoglossum officinale), suggest that Blue Hound's Tongue could become a major problem in Australia. In Canada, Hound's Tongue has become a major economic problem, with logged forests providing an ideal habitat for seedling establishment. Other factors, such as seed dispersal by livestock, a favourable climate and a topography that hinders mechanical and chemical control, have helped the plant spread from a few sparsely scattered weeds in the 1960s to a current infestation of 2000 ha (CRC 2003).\n\nAnother closely related species, Cynoglossum coeruleum, is also considered a weed and its importation into Australia is banned by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (CRC 2003).",

    "impact": "Artichoke Thistle (Cynara cardunculus) is largely known as a pest of agricultural areas (particularly pastures), and a weed of crops and disturbed sites. It invades natural habitats most commonly in grasslands, open woodlands, as well as roadsides, gardens, waste areas and disturbed sites. It can easily dominate the vegetation in densely infested areas, smothering most desirable ground-dwelling plants.\n\nAgriculture: Artichoke Thistle is a serious weed of  permanent pastures, and occasionally Lucerne. Once established, it dominates the vegetation of an area, out competing and smothering most desirable pasture species drawing most moisture and nutrients from the soil (Parsons and Cuthbertson 2001). The spiky nature of the plant deters grazing by stock and restricts their movement in dense infestations, but animals will eat the leaves when hungry and no other feed is available. It has low nutrient value and may cause stomach impaction and mechanical injuries, but is not poisonous (Government of South Australia 2014).\n\nNative ecosystems: Artichoke Thistle can invades natural habitats,  for example, grasslands, open woodlands, and wetlands and riparian areas in drier regions, smothering native ground-dwelling plants. In Victoria, it invades lowland grassland and grassy woodland, and riparian vegetation (Carr et al. 1992).\n\nUrban areas: Can invade disturbed sites and gardens, and is reported to cause dermatitis in some people.",

    "impact": "Golden Dodder was included in the list of 71 species that were nominated by state and territory governments for assessment as Weeds of National Significance (WONS). Following an assessment process, Golden Dodder was not included as one of the 20 WONS. However, it remains a weed of potential national significance.\n\nAgriculture: Golden Dodder is largely known as a pest of crops, particularly of plants belonging to the daisy (Asteraceae) and legume (Fabaceae) plant families. Numerous commercial crops have been attacked in Australia including a wide range of different field crops, pasture legumes, vegetables and horticultural plants (e.g., Lucerne, Lupins, Tomato, Zucchini, Carrot, Celery, Onion and Lettuce). Crop yields can be significantly reduced, through the loss of nutrients from parasitism and through shading caused by the dense mass of stems that develops on heavily infested hosts. Infested areas may also need to be quarantined for several years before crops can be grown again (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Golden Dodder can also be a nuisance pest in nurseries and home gardens.\n\nNative ecosystems: This species also attacks a wide range of naturalised species and native plants growing in pastures, along roadsides and in natural areas (e.g. Noogoora Burr (Xanthium strumarium) [as Xanthium occidentale], Smartweeds, Persicaria spp. and Lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta)). It has been reported from grasslands, open woodlands, coastal vine thickets, riparian areas and wetlands. In fact, Golden Dodder is regarded as an environmental weed in some parts of Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. It is actively managed by community groups in Western Australia and was recently listed as a priority environmental weed in three Natural Resource Management regions. It is of particular concern as an environmental weed in inland wetland areas. For example, it frequently grows on plants along the margins of Willandra Creek and its lagoons in Willandra National Park in the Riverina region of southern New South Wales and is also seen as a threat to the natural integrity of the Lake Lalbert Wildlife Reserve in northern Victoria (Navie & Adkins 2007).",

It grows rapidly and smothers other plants, often completely dominating the vegetation and spreading aggressively from waterways into adjoining open woodlands and pastures.\n\nRubber Vine has significant impacts on the pastoral industry and conservation areas in north-eastern Australia. Its main impact on pastoralism is the loss of grazing country, which in 1995 was estimated to cost the Queensland beef industry $18 million (CRC 2003). It is toxic to livestock and dense infestations replace productive species, rendering grazing country less productive or even useless. It also increases the costs of mustering and fencing.\n\nRubber Vine threatens waterways, woodlands and rainforests throughout north-eastern Australia, including significant conservation areas such as the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area and Cape York Peninsula. It is particularly invasive in riverine vegetation, and can potentially displace the plants and animals that inhabit riverbanks, thereby affecting the water quality of streams.

In the western United States Common Crupina is described as an aggressive competitor because of its climate and soil adaptability, high reproductive rate and efficient dispersal. In the 22 years since it was first detected it has spread to and infested over 25 000 hectares, sometimes forming nearly solid stands that exclude desirable plants\n\nAgriculture: Common Crupina could impact on grazing over significant areas of southern Australia. It invades rangeland, pastures, natural areas and waste places (Cunningham et al. 2004). Adapted to a wide range of soil and climate conditions, it can form solid stands, which decrease forage productivity and livestock carrying capacity. Although it is not toxic, livestock tend to avoid Common Crupina. The stem and leaf margins develop short, stiff hairs as the plant bolts. Therefore, it is only palatable to livestock in the rosette stage (Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board 1999).\n\nNative ecosystems: It may also compete with native grassland plants (DPIW 2006) and succeed in other types of open native and degraded vegetation. In the western United States it forms dense populations that invade grasslands, forested areas, canyons, riparian areas that displace native plants, and impair plant communities by reducing biodiversity.\n\nUrban areas: In the western United States it also forms dense populations on roadsides and waste areas.",

It forms dense thickets that can impede movement of stock and humans.\n\nNative ecosystems: Azzarola can spread away from plantings during favorable conditions into native grasslands, woodlands, forest areas, and poorly managed pastures. These dense patches can also provide cover for pest animals such as rabbits (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Azarola can have a major impact on bushland habitats, shading out ground-flora and affecting the growth and regeneration of overstorey plants. It is likely that the leaves dropped each autumn impact on biodiversity by increasing nutrients levels in surface soil. Dense patches compete with native regrowth and form spiny thickets that provide good cover for rabbits and other pests (Government of South Australia 2021). In the Adelaide Foothills, Azzarola together with introduced Olives have invaded many hectares across a hillside at Mount Osmond Reserve, between Waterfall Gully road and the Lookout with little to no native vegetation remaining.\n\nAgriculture: It can form dense stands that reduce grazing capacity of stock due to exclusion and as the spines act as a deterrent. Due to the presence of hydrocyanic acid in some Crataegus species, Hawthorn is potentially hazardous to grazing stock (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). In the British Isles, Crataegus species are an important reservoir of the fire blight bacterium which affects pears and apples. Azzarola also is known to host Mediterranean fruit fly and light brown apple moth (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nIt is assumed that this could have similar or worse impacts as Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna).

    "impact": "Hawthorn has invaded forests, woodlands and riparian areas throughout south east Australia (DPI NSW 2019). May forms infestations on roadsides and in disturbed bush where it can compete with native regrowth and form spiny thickets that harbor rabbits. In Victoria, it has been found that may can spread over neglected perennial pastures from former hedge plantings and in this situation it would cause a similar problem to weedy Blackberries and briars (wild weedy roses) (Government of South Australia 2021).\n\nNative ecosystems: Widely used as a hedge plant, Hawthorn can spread away from plantings during favorable conditions into native grasslands, woodlands, forest areas, and poorly managed pastures. These dense patches can also provide cover for pest animals such as rabbits (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Hawthorn can displace native species in remnant grassy vegetation in farming areas, can shade-out native flora, and adversely affect the growth and regeneration of over-story plants (Muyt 2001; Miles undated). Dense stands can also inhibit the movement of large fauna, and can significantly reduce available habitat (Muyt 2001; University of California undated). Hawthorn may therefore have long term impacts on native plant community structure, and poses a threat to bushland, reserves and conservation areas (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy 2001).\n\nAgriculture: It can form dense stands that reduce grazing capacity of stock due to exclusion and as the spines act as a deterrent. Seedlings of Hawthorn rarely establish in pastures that are regularly grazed (Tamar Valley Weed Strategy 2001). Due to the presence of hydrocyanic acid in some Crataegus species, Hawthorn is potentially hazardous to grazing stock (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). Hawthorn can be a reservoir for the fire blight bacterium that affects apple and pear crops (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001), and can host light-brown apple moth (Holding & Bowcher 2007). Dense patches of may provide good cover for rabbits and other pests. In the British Isles, May and other hawthorns are an important reservoir of the fire blight bacterium, which affects pears and apples. May also is known to host Mediterranean fruit fly and light brown apple moth (Government of South Australia 2021).",

    "origin": "Hawthorn has a very wide native range in western Europe, the Mediterranean region, Asia Minor and Afghanistan (Parsons 1973; Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001). It is considered weedy in several countries including Australia, north-eastern United States, where it occurs widely (GRIN 2007; USDA 2007), and New Zealand, where it is occasional but widespread on the North and South Islands and Stewart Island (Parsons & Cuthbertson 2001; Roy et al. 2004).",
